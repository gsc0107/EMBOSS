DOMAINER reads a DCF file (domain classification file) and a directory of protein 
CCF files (clean coordinate files) and writes, for each domain in the DCF 
file, a domain CCF file and domain PDB file.  Each domain CCF 
file contains coordinates for a single SCOP domain.  The paths 
and extensions for the protein (input) and domain (output) coordinate 
files are specified by the user (path) and in the ACD file (extension).  The SCOP domain 
identifier codes are used to name the output files.  A log file for each 
of the DCF and PDB format builds is written.



<!-- INPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of input file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.

     appropriate.

<b>Wildcard matching of SCOP domain start and end points</b>
<br>SCOP treats PDB residue numbers as integers and this is a potential source
of error in the domain ranges. It means that DOMAINER (via library calls)
must use wild card strings when matching a SCOP start / end point to the
PDB residue number strings.

Where coordinates for multiple models are given in a protein coordinate 
file, the domain CCF file will contain coordinates for the first 
model.  
<br>
<br>In the rare cases where a domain is comprised of segments from more than 
one chain, the data in the domain CCF file will be presented as 
belonging to a single chain with a chain identifier of '.'.  A single 
sequence will be given.
<br>
<br>The start and end positions of domains in SCOP coincide in several cases 
to residues which either lack a CA atom or for which coordinates for a 
single atom only are given in the PDB file.  To ensure these domains are
processed during a DOMAINER run, it is important to use protein CCF
files which have NOT been masked to remove such residues.
Otherwise errors of the following type may occur in the log file:

<!-- DESCRIPTION

-->
<a name="9.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 9.0   DESCRIPTION               </H2>
  
 DOMAINER fills the need for a convenient source of protein coordinate data which 
 includes protein strucutral domain definitions and is therefore appropriate 
 for domain-centred approaches.  DOMAINER reads protein CCF files and
 writes files of coordinate data for individual SCOP domains in clean 
 and PDB formats. Domain definitions are taken from  a DCF file (domain classification file).  For example, SCOPPARSE parses the raw SCOP classification files (dir.cla.scop.txt and dir.des.scop.txt) available at URL (http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/) and generate a DCF output file suitable for use with DOMAINER.

-->
<a name="10.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 10.0  ALGORITHM                 </H2>
We wrote the DOMAINER application to read protein CCF files and generate files of coordinates for single SCOP domains in the "clean" format (domain CCF files, Figure 1) and the PDB format.  DOMAINER reads a file of domain classification data (e.g. prepared by using the application SCOPPARSE or CATHPARSE), and generates a domain CCF and domain PDB file for each domain listed.  Where coordinates for multiple models were determined, data in the output files are given for the first model only.  In cases where a domain consists of sections from more than one polypeptide chain, the data are presented as belonging to a single chain only (a single sequence with a chain identifier of is given).

<br><br><br><H2> 12.0  DIAGNOSTIC ERROR MESSAGES </H2>
DOMAINER generates a log file an excerpt of which is shown (Figure 2). If there is a problem in processing a domain, three lines containing the record '//', the domain identifier code and an error message respectively are written. The following messages may then be given.

<br><br><i>WARN  filename not found</i> (A CCF file could not be found).
<br><br><i>ERROR filename file read error</i> (An error was encountered during a file read or write respectively.)
<br><br><i>ERROR filename file write error</i> (An error was encountered during a file read or write respectively.)  
<br><br><i>ERROR Domain start found by wildcard match only</i> (Wildcard matching was needed to find the start (or end) of a domain in a PDB file: see below).
<br><br>
Various other error messages may also be given (in case of difficulty email Jon Ison, jison@ebi.ac.uk).
