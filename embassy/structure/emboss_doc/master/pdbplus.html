<!-- SUMMARY
     Succint description of the application, particularly its inputs, outputs
     and what it does.  The same text is given at the top of the source (.c)

     of the ACD file.

<br><br><br><H2> 2.0   INPUTS & OUTPUTS          </H2>
PDBPLUS reads a directory of domain OR protein CCF files (clean coordinate files) and writes
a directory containing the same files as the input directory but in which 
values for records for secondary structure and residue accessibility are
given.  These data are calculated by using the STRIDE and NACCESS programs
and these must be installed on the system that is running PDBPLUS (see Section 8.0
below).  PDBPLUS also requires a directory containing files in PDB format
for each coordinate file in the input directory: either the original PDB file 
(for proteins) or domain PDB files generated by using DOMAINER (for domains).  The paths 
and extensions of the pdb (input) and coordinate (input and output) files are 
specified by the user (file extensions are given in the ACD file).  The names of the 
output CCF files will be identical to those that are read.

<br><br>PDBPLUS generates 3 log files containing diagnostic messages for various problems encountered by PDBPARSE, STRIDE or NACCESS respectively (see Section 12.0 below).  


<!-- INPUT FILE FORMAT

<H3> 6.2 EXAMPLE SESSION </H3>
An example of interactive use of PDBPLUS is shown below.

<!--#include file="inc/pdbplus.usage" -->
<!--
All CCF files were read from testdata/pdbplus/ccfin and CCF files (annotated with values for secondary structure and solvent accessibility) were written to testdata/pdbplus/ccfout.  The STRIDE and NACCESS programs ran on PDB files within testdata/. Three log files (pdbplus.log, naccess.log and stride.log) were written. The threshold size for secondary structure elements was 4 residues.  File extension of all input and output files would be set in the ACD file. -->



<!-- KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS
     Bugs that have not yet been fixed, easily missued features, problems
     and caveats etc. Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.
-->
<a name="7.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 7.0   KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS     </H2>
NACCESS and STRIDE do not always work as advertised owing, e.g. to arbitrary array limits in their code.  If the derived data appears to be missing from the PDDBPARSE output this is probably why.





<!-- NOTES
     Important general remarks, including:
       Restrictions.
       Interesting behaviour.
       Useful things you can do with this program.

<br><br><br><H2> 9.0   DESCRIPTION               </H2>
PDBPLUS is a wrapper to the STRIDE [1] and NACCESS [2] programs that adds derived data (i - iv below) to a CCF file.  The values of the derived data for a given residue will of course depend on whether they were calculated from the coordinates for the entire structure or just the domain, i.e. whether PDBPLUS is provided with protein or domain CCF files.  Thus PDBPLUS provides useful flexibility in generating the derived data.
<br>
<UL>
<LI>  Absolute (Abs.) and relative (Rel.) accessible surface area of residues according to NACCESS.  Abs. is the summed accessible surface area of the atoms, whereas Rel. is expressed as a percentage relative to the accessibility of the atoms in an extended ALA-x-ALA tri-peptide conformation.  The NACCESS authors treat alpha carbons as side-chain atoms so that glycine can have a value for side-chain accessible surface area (see 'Database format' below).  They are therefore not included in the main-chain.  
<LI>  Phi and Psi angle and solvent accessible surface area of residues as calculated by using STRIDE.  
<LI>  Secondary structure assignment according to STRIDE, one of 'H' (alpha helix), 'G' (3-10 helix), 'I' (Pi-helix), 'E' (extended conformation), 'B' or 'b' (isolated bridge), 'T' (turn) or 'C' (coil, i.e. none of the above).  
<LI>  The number of helical or beta-strand secondary structure elements (SSEs) in the chain or domain.  An 'element' is defined as a run of a user-defined number (typically 4) of residues in the 'H', 'G' or 'I' conformation (helices) or the 'E' conformation (beta-strands).  
</UL>



<!-- ALGORITHM
     A technical description of algorithmic aspects, describing exactly how
     the key aspects of the application work.
-->
<a name="10.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 10.0  ALGORITHM                 </H2>
Values in the CCF file for the number of helices (NH) or beta-strands (NE) in a chain and columns 12-13 and 22-34 of the coordinate line record (CO) are given null values ('.' or 0) by PDBPARSE (see Section 4.0).  PDBPLUS is used to assign values to these these records.



<!-- RELATED APPLICATIONS
     Other applications that either generate the input, use the output or 
     are in some other way related to the application are described here.

     Description of error messages or log file, if one is written.

<a name="12.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 12.0  DIAGNOSTIC ERROR MESSAGES </H2>
The following messages (in "quotes") may appear in the PDBPARSE log file (an explanation is given in parenethesis). 

<UL>
<LI>"clean coordinate file not found my.file" (a clean coordinate input file was not found for input)
<LI>"ERROR Clean coordinate file read error: my.file" (error in reading clean coordinate file)
<LI>"no stride output for: my.file" (No STRIDE output was generated for my.file)
<LI>"stride output for: my.file" (STRIDE output *was* generated for my.file)
<LI>"no naccess output for:" (No NACCESS output was generated for my.file)
<LI>"naccess output for:" (NACCESS output *was* generated for my.file)
<LI>"PDB file not found: my.file" (a pdb file was not found for input)
<LI>"Could not write results file: my.file" (output file could not be written)
<LI>"Could not convert chain id A to chain number in pdb file my.file" (chain identifier was not found in the clean coordinate file)
<LI>"STRIDE  failures: %12\nNACCESS failures: 123" (STRIDE failed for 12 pdb files and NACCESS failed for 123 pdb files.  The clean coordinate files will lack the appropriate data (see Section 10.0).
