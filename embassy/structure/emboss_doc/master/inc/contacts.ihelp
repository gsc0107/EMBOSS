   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-cpdbdir]           dirlist    [./] This option specifies the location of
                                  CCF files (clean coordinate files) (input).
                                  A 'clean cordinate file' contains protein
                                  coordinate and derived data for a single PDB
                                  file ('protein clean coordinate file') or a
                                  single domain from SCOP or CATH ('domain
                                  clean coordinate file'), in CCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files, generated by using
                                  PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER (domains),
                                  contain 'cleaned-up' data that is
                                  self-consistent and error-corrected. Records
                                  for residue solvent accessibility and
                                  secondary structure are added to the file by
                                  using PDBPLUS.
   -vdwfile            datafile   [Evdw.dat] This option specifies the name of
                                  the data file with van der Waals radii of
                                  atoms for different amino acid residues.
   -threshold          float      [1.0] Contact between two residues is
                                  defined as when the van der Waals surface of
                                  any atom of the first residue comes within
                                  the threshold contact distance of the van
                                  der Waals surface of any atom of the second
                                  residue. The threshold contact distance is a
                                  user-defined distance with a default value
                                  of 1 Angstrom. (Any numeric value)
  [-conoutdir]         outdir     [./] This option specifies the location of
                                  CON files (contact files) (output). A
                                  'contact file' contains contact data for a
                                  protein or a domain from SCOP or CATH, in
                                  the CON format (EMBL-like). The contacts may
                                  be intra-chain residue-residue, inter-chain
                                  residue-residue or residue-ligand. The
                                  files are generated by using CONTACTS,
                                  INTERFACE and SITES.
   -conlogfile         outfile    [contacts.log] The log file contains
                                  messages about any errors arising while
                                  contacts ran.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -[no]ccfnaming      boolean    [Y] This option specifies whether to use
                                  pdbid code to name the output files. If set,
                                  the PDB identifier code (from the PDB file)
                                  is used to name the file. Otherwise, the
                                  output files have the same names as the
                                  input files.
   -skip               boolean    [N] Whether to calculate contacts between
                                  residue adjacent in sequence.
   -ignore             float      [20.0] If any two atoms from two different
                                  residues are at least this distance apart
                                  then no futher inter-atomic contacts will be
                                  checked for for that residue pair . This
                                  speeds the calculation up considerably. (Any
                                  numeric value)
