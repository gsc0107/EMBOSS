                                  file by using PDBPLUS.
  [-dcffile]           infile     This option specifies the name of the DCF
                                  file (domain classification file) (input). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   -threshold          float      This option specifies the threshold contact
