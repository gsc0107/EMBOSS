Author(s)

   This program is an EMBOSS conversion of a program written by Ivo
   Hofacker as part of his VIENNA package.

   Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
   version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
   that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
   before publication.

   Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
   not to the original author.
