1.0.0
	Added ':' to switch to command mode in addition to control-Z as
	used in VMS versions and also useful when defining QA tests.

	Redefined the way help redraws the screen to simply call MSE's
	redraw function with a reset layout. The previous method used
	curses calls and caused trouble when ncurses was linked.

	Trimmed the help text to be no more than 80 characters wide.
