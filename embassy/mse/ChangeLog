4.0.0
	Fixed compiler warnings in 3 string manipulation functions that
	relpace single characters (T/U for DNA and RNA or general
	replacements)

1.0.0
	Added 'Control-D' as an alias for delete. MSE was using the
	VMS/EDT keypad ',' key which is not available on most Unix
	workstations.
	
	Added ':' to switch to command mode in addition to control-Z as
	used in VMS versions and also useful when defining QA tests.

	Redefined the way help redraws the screen to simply call MSE's
	redraw function with a reset layout. The previous method used
	curses calls and caused trouble when ncurses was linked.

	Trimmed the help text to be no more than 80 characters wide.
