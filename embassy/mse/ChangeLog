6.1.0
	Allow missing input sequence set to allow editing from scratch

	Add new qualifier -gcgmode to enable alternative keystrokes
	(e.g. ctrl-D for the command line) used by the Unix version of the
	GCG seqed editor.

	Redraw entire screen after display of help pages, or when using
	the redraw command or shortcut keys (ctrl-R or ctrl-W)

4.0.0
	Fixed compiler warnings in 3 string manipulation functions that
	relpace single characters (T/U for DNA and RNA or general
	replacements)

1.0.0
	Added 'Control-D' as an alias for delete. MSE was using the
	VMS/EDT keypad ',' key which is not available on most Unix
	workstations.
	
	Added ':' to switch to command mode in addition to control-Z as
	used in VMS versions and also useful when defining QA tests.

	Redefined the way help redraws the screen to simply call MSE's
	redraw function with a reset layout. The previous method used
	curses calls and caused trouble when ncurses was linked.

	Trimmed the help text to be no more than 80 characters wide.
