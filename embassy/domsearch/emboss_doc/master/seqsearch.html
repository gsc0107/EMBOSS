<br><br><br><H2> 2.0   INPUTS & OUTPUTS          </H2>
SEQSEARCH reads a directory of i. single protein sequences or ii. set of protein sequences (aligned or unaligned) and generates a DHF file ('domain hits file') of sequence relatives (hits) for each file in the input directory.  The hits are sequence relatives to the input sequences and are found by using PSIBLAST. Only unique hits are generated; only one of a set of identical hits returned by PSIBLAST is retained.
<br><br>Typically, aligned sequences within a DAF file ('domain alignment file') are input and the DHF file output is annotated with domain classification data.
<br><br>PSIBLAST must be installed on the system that is running SEQSEARCH (see 'Notes' below). The base name of an input file is used as the base name for the corresponding output file. The paths and extensions for the sequence files (input) and domain hits files (output) are specified by the user.  The name of the BLAST-indexed database to search are also user-specified.  A log file is also written.




<!-- INPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of input file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.

     Cannot use the test data files because they might be empty or need 
     hand-editing 

     Use "<b>SEQSEARCH</b> reads any normal sequence USAs." if
     appropriate.

<a name="3.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 3.0   INPUT FILE FORMAT         </H2>

The format of the domain alignment file is described in <a href="domainalign.html">DOMAINALIGN documentation</a>. 
<br>If other sequences or sequence sets (aligned or unaligned) are used as input, all of the common file formats are supported.

<!--#include file="inc/seqsearch.input" -->

<!-- OUTPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of output file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.  
     If the standard description of the avalable report formats is required, 
     use:   #include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml"
     Use "Outputs a graph to the specified graphics device."
     or  "outputs a report format file. The default format is ..."
     if appropriate.

SEQSEARCH generates a domain hits file in FASTA-like format (<a href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a>).

<a name="Figure1"></a>
<br><br> <b>Figure 1 DHF file (FASTA-like format)</b>
<br>The file (Figure 1) contains two lines per hit. The first contains a description of the hit in 16 text tokens delimited by '^'.  The tokens are as follows (a '.' is given where a token does not have a value).

The first 4 tokens are specific to the sequence of the hit:
<UL>
<LI>(i) Accession number of the hit.  
<LI>(ii)  Database code from Uniprot.  
<LI>(iii - iv) Start and end positions of the hit relative to the full length sequence in the uniprot database (files of these type may also be generated by using SEQWORDS in which case a '.' will be given for these records - see <a href="seqwords.html">SEQWORDS documentation </a>). 
</UL>

The next 9 tokens are specific to the domain (or domain family or other node) for which the hit was generated:
<UL>
<LI>(v)  Type of domain; currently either 'SCOP' or 'CATH' is given.
<LI>(vi)  SCOP or CATH domain identifier.  This is a 7-character code that uniquely identifies the domain in SCOP or CATH.
<LI>(vii) SCOP or CATH node unique identifier. For example, if the domain alignment file was for a SCOP family, the SCOP Sunid for the family would be given. This number uniquely identifies the node (i.e. family in this case) in the raw SCOP or CATH parsable files. 
<LI>(viii) Domain class.  Textual description of the 'Class' (SCOP and CATH domains). 
<LI>(ix) Domain architecture. Textual description of the 'Architecture' (CATH only). 
<LI>(x) Domain topology. Textual description of the 'Topology' (CATH only).  
<LI>(xi) Domain fold. Textual description of the 'Fold' (SCOP domains only).  
<LI>(xii) Domain superfamily. Textual description of the 'Superfamily' (SCOP and CATH domains).  
<LI>(xiii) Domain family. Textual description of the 'Fold' (SCOP only). 
</UL>

The next 4 tokens are specific to the hit itself:
<UL>
<LI>(xiv) Model type.  The type of model that was used to generate the hit. May have a value of "PSIBLAST" (from PSIBLAST), "HMMER" (hidden Markov model from the HMMER package), "SAM" (hidden Markov model from the SAM package), SPARSE (sparse protein signature), HENIKOFF (Henikoff profile) or GRIBSKOV (Gribskov profile). A value of "PSIBLAST" is written by SEQSEARCH, a value of "KEYWORD" is written by SEQWORDS.
<LI>(xv) SC - Score of hit. A floating point value that is the score from psiblast (or other search algorithm). 
<LI>(xvi) P-value of hit from search algorithm. 
<LI>(xvii) E-value of hit from search algorithm. The second line contains the protein sequence.
</UL>

<H3> 6.2 EXAMPLE SESSION </H3>
An example of interactive use of SEQSEARCH is shown below.

<!--#include file="inc/seqsearch.usage" -->

<!-- All domain alignment files (with the file extension of .daf specified in the ACD file) were read from the directory /test_data; in this case two domain alignment files 54894.salign and 55074.salign were read. Sets of sequences extracted from these files were used to search the sequence database swissprot by using psiblast.  psiblast was configured to perform 1 iteration with a threshold E-value for acceptance of a hit of 0.0001 and no more than 100 hits were generated from each iteration.  Domain hits files were written to /test_data/seqsearch ( the file extension .dhf was specified in the ACD file); in this case two files /test_data/54894.dhf and /test_data/55074.dhf were written.  A log file called /test_data/seqsearch/seqsearch.log was also written. -->

<b>  1. Use of psiblast</b><br>
psiblast must be installed on the system that is running SEQSEARCH.

<br><br>SEQSEARCH requires a blast-indexed database to be present, i.e. both the sequence and index file must be present on the system.  The name of the database to search specified in the acd file is that which is given as the -d parameter to blastpgp (e.g. blastpgp -d swissprot).

<!-- DESCRIPTION
     A complete, non-technical, user-level description of the application.
-->
<a name="9.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 9.0   DESCRIPTION               </H2>
By using homology search tools such as blast it is possible to find relatives to a group of related proteins (family, superfamily etc), given one or more sequences belonging to the group of interest.  For example, when using psiblast it is possible to use a sequence alignment as the seed with which to search a sequence database.  Performing such searches for large datasets such as all families within SCOP or CATH potentially requires a lot of time for preparation of datasets, running jobs and so on, in addition to the compute time required for the searches themselves.  SEQSEARCH automatically performs a psiblast search of a sequence database for each file in a directory of sequences or sets of sequences.  These sequences are used for the searches.  Typically, the directory contains DAF files (domain alignment files) and the alignments are for a certain node (e.g. family, superfamily etc) from SCOP or CATH.
