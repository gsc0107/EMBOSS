SEQSORT reads a directory of DHF files (domain hits files) where each file contains hits to a single SCOP family, compares, processes and collates the hits and writes a directory of DHF files which contain only those hits that could be uniquely assigned to a SCOP family. Optionally, two further files of hits are written: (i) a domain families file, of ALL hits from the input files that could be uniquely assigned to a SCOP family and (ii) a domain ambiguities file, of hits from ALL the input files that are of ambiguous family assignment and are assigned as relatives to a SCOP superfamily or fold instead.

<br> The path for the domain hits files (input and output) and the names of the output files are specified by the user.  The file extension of the DHF files are set in the ACD file.





<!-- INPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of input file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.

     Cannot use the test data files because they might be empty or need 
     hand-editing

     appropriate.

The format of the domain hits file is described in <a href="seqsearch.html">SEQSEARCH documentation.</a>

<br><br> The domain families file and domain ambiguities file also use the DHF format.  Whereas normally a DHF file contains hits for a single node from SCOP or CATH, the families and ambiguities files may contain domains from multiple different families (domain families file), or superfamilies or folds (ambiguities file).  Domains of the same node (e.g. family) will be grouped together in blocks, i.e. all hits for domain A, then all hits for domain B and so on (see Figure 1).

<!-- DESCRIPTION
     A complete, non-technical, user-level description of the application.
-->
<a name="9.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 9.0   DESCRIPTION               </H2>

The results of multiple searches of a sequence database using an homology search tool such as blast may contain overlapping or identical hits, especially where the query sequences are related, for instance, belong to different families but the same superfamily.  For certain analyses it is desirable to assign a hit with confidence to a unique family, or otherwise assign it as a member of a larger superfamily or fold instead.  SEQSORT reads a directory of DHF files (domain hits files) where each file containing hits to a different SCOP family, compares, processes and collates the hits and writes a directory of DHF files which contain only those hits that could be uniquely assigned to a SCOP family.  Optionally, two further files are written: (i) a domain families file, of hits (from ALL the input files) that could be uniquely assigned to a SCOP family and (ii) a domain ambiguities file, for hits (from ALL the input files) of ambiguous family assignment which are assigned as relatives to a SCOP superfamily or fold instead.


<!-- ALGORITHM
     A technical description of algorithmic aspects, describing exactly how
     the key aspects of the application work.
-->
<a name="10.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 10.0  ALGORITHM                 </H2>

A rough outline of the algorithm follows; a better description will appear in a publication in preparation.  Hits from searches for all domain families are collated into a single list and the list sorted according to family name.  The hits hits within each family are sorted by accession number, then hits within a family and with identical accession number are sorted by the start position of the hit relative to the full length sequence in swissprot.  In each family identical hits (i.e. those with identical accession number and the same start and end points relative to the full-length sequence in swissprot) were removed leaving only a single copy.  Each family is also processed so that ovlerapping hits (hits with identical accesssion number that overlap by at least a user-defined number of residues) are replaced by a hit that is produced from merging the two overlapping hits.  If two hits have the same accession number and overlap but are from searches for different families, the hits are merged and the merged hit placed into a new list for hits to superfamilies (if the two families belonged to the same superfamily) or for hits to folds (if the two families were in different superfamilies but the same fold).  In this way hits that are unique to a particular family are identified, and hits of ambiguous family assignment are assigned as belonging to a superfamily or fold instead.
