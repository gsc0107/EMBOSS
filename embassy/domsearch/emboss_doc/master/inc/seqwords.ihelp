   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-keyfile]           infile     This option specifies the name of keywords
                                  file (input). This contains a list of
                                  keywords specific to a number of SCOP or
                                  CATH families and superfamilies used by
                                  SEQWORDS to search a sequence database.
  [-spfile]            infile     This option specifies the name of the
                                  sequence database (input) to search.
  [-outfile]           outfile    This option specifies the name of the DHF
                                  file (domain hits file) (output). A 'domain
                                  hits file' contains database hits
                                  (sequences) with domain classification
                                  information, in the DHF format (FASTA-like).
                                  The hits are relatives to a SCOP or CATH
                                  family (or other node in the structural
                                  hierarchies) and are found from a search of
                                  a sequence database. Files containing hits
                                  retrieved by PSIBLAST are generated by using
                                  SEQSEARCH, hits retrieved by a sparse
                                  protein signatare by using SIGSCAN or
                                  various types of HMM and profile by using
                                  LIBSCAN.
