   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-dhfindir]          directory  This option specifies the location of DHF
                                  files (domain hits files) (input). A 'domain
                                  hits file' contains database hits
                                  (sequences) with domain classification
                                  information, in the DHF format (FASTA or
                                  EMBL-like). The hits are relatives to a SCOP
                                  or CATH family and are found from a search
                                  of a sequence database. Files containing
                                  hits retrieved by PSIBLAST are generated by
                                  using SEQSEARCH.
   -overlap            integer    This option specifies the number of
                                  overlapping residues required for merging of
                                  two hits. Each family is also processed so
                                  that ovlerapping hits (hits with identical
                                  accesssion number that overlap by at least a
                                  user-defined number of residues) are
                                  replaced by a hit that is produced from
                                  merging the two overlapping hits.
   -dofamilies         toggle     This option specifies to write a domain
                                  families file. If this option is set a
                                  domain families file is written.
   -doambiguities      toggle     This option specifies whether to write a
                                  domain ambiguities file. If this option is
                                  set a domain ambiguities file is written.
  [-dhfoutdir]         outdir     This option specifies the location of DHF
                                  files (domain hits files) (output). A
                                  'domain hits file' contains database hits
                                  (sequences) with domain classification
                                  information, in the DHF format (FASTA or
                                  EMBL-like). The hits are relatives to a SCOP
                                  or CATH family and are found from a search
                                  of a sequence database. Files containing
                                  hits retrieved by PSIBLAST are generated by
                                  using SEQSEARCH.
*  -hitsfile           outfile    This option specifies the name of domain
                                  families file (output). A 'domain families
                                  file' contains sequence relatives (hits) for
                                  each of a number of different SCOP or CATH
                                  families found from searching a sequence
                                  database, e.g. by using SEQSEARCH
                                  (psiblast). The file contains the collated
                                  search results for the indvidual families;
                                  only those hits of unambiguous family
                                  assignment are included. Hits of ambiguous
                                  family assignment are assigned as relatives
                                  to a SCOP or CATH superfamily or fold
                                  instead and are collated into a 'domain
                                  ambiguities file'. The domain families and
                                  ambiguities files are generated by using
                                  SEQSORT and use the same format as a DHF
                                  file (domain hits file).
*  -ambigfile          outfile    This option specifies the name of domain
                                  ambiguities file (output). A 'domain
                                  families file' contains sequence relatives
                                  (hits) for each of a number of different
                                  SCOP or CATH families found from searching a
                                  sequence database, e.g. by using SEQSEARCH
                                  (psiblast). The file contains the collated
                                  search results for the indvidual families;
                                  only those hits of unambiguous family
                                  assignment are included. Hits of ambiguous
                                  family assignment are assigned as relatives
                                  to a SCOP or CATH superfamily or fold
                                  instead and are collated into a 'domain
                                  ambiguities file'. The domain families and
                                  ambiguities files are generated by using
                                  SEQSORT and use the same format as a DHF
                                  file (domain hits file).
