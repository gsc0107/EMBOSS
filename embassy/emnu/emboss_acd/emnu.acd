  help: "After every command that you run in the menu, either by
         selecting the name of an EMBOSS program, or by typing the command in
         the command line, a check is made to see if any new files have been
         created by that command. If so, the command 'more filenames' will
         be put into the comamnd line ready for you to quickly view those new
         files. If you do not wish this to happen, set this to be false."

  help: "The groups that EMBOSS applications belong to have two forms,
         exploded and not exploded. The exploded group names are more
         numerous and often vaguely phrased than the non-exploded ones. The
         exploded names are formed from definitions of the group names that
         start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are then expanded into many
         combinations of the names as: 'NAME1', 'NAME2', 'NAME1 NAME2', NAME2
         NAME1'. The non-expanded names are simply like: 'NAME1 NAME2'."
