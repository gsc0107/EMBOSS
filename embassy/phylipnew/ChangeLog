	frestdist had a memory access error reported by valgrind. The same
	error was found in the original phylip source, and fixed by
	copying in code changes in phylip 3.66

	fclique had an error reading the ancestors file. Results now agree
	with those from the original phylip 3.6 code.

	fdnamove had an internal overflow. Array chh[11] needed at least
	one extra space.
