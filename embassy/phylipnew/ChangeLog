	Updated all code to phylip 3.67. The output of sevral programs has
	changed - see the phylip release notes for details. Programs with
	changed output are all the molecular clock algorithms : fcontml,
	fdnaml, fdnamlk, proml, promlk, restml. ftreedist and ftreedistpair
	branch score distance output has also changed in phylip 3.67

	fontfile now works correctly in fdrawgram and fdrawtree. The
	fontfile value must be a known phylip font in the data directory.

	previewing with X11 was broken. Setting "none" for previewer no
	longer prompts before plotting.

	frestdist had a memory access error reported by valgrind. The same
	error was found in the original phylip source, and fixed by
	copying in code changes in phylip 3.66

	fclique had an error reading the ancestors file. Results now agree
	with those from the original phylip 3.6 code.

	fdnamove had an internal overflow. Array chh[11] needed at least
	one extra space.
