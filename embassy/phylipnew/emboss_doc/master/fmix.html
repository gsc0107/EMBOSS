<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Estimates phylogenies by some parsimony methods for discrete character
data with two states (0 and 1). Allows use of the Wagner parsimony
method, the Camin-Sokal parsimony method, or arbitrary mixtures of
these. Also reconstructs ancestral states and allows weighting of
characters (does not infer branch lengths).


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


MIX is a general parsimony program which carries out the Wagner and
Camin-Sokal parsimony methods in mixture, where each character can
have its method specified separately. The program defaults to carrying
out Wagner parsimony.

<p>
The Camin-Sokal parsimony method explains the data by assuming that
changes 0 --&gt; 1 are allowed but not changes 1 --&gt; 0. Wagner parsimony
allows both kinds of changes. (This under the assumption that 0 is the
ancestral state, though the program allows reassignment of the
ancestral state, in which case we must reverse the state numbers 0 and
1 throughout this discussion). The criterion is to find the tree which
requires the minimum number of changes. The Camin-Sokal method is due
to Camin and Sokal (1965) and the Wagner method to Eck and Dayhoff
(1966) and to Kluge and Farris (1969).

<p>
Here are the assumptions of these two methods: 


<ol>

<li>
Ancestral states are known (Camin-Sokal) or unknown (Wagner). 

<li>
Different characters evolve independently. 

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>
Changes 0 --&gt; 1 are much more probable than changes 1 --&gt; 0
(Camin-Sokal) or equally probable (Wagner).

<li>
Both of these kinds of changes are a priori improbable over the
evolutionary time spans involved in the differentiation of the group
in question.

<li>
Other kinds of evolutionary event such as retention of polymorphism
are far less probable than 0 --&gt; 1 changes.

<li>
Rates of evolution in different lineages are sufficiently low that two
changes in a long segment of the tree are far less probable than one
change in a short segment.


</ol>

<p>
That these are the assumptions of parsimony methods has been
documented in a series of papers of mine: (1973a, 1978b, 1979, 1981b,
1983b, 1988b). For an opposing view arguing that the parsimony methods
make no substantive assumptions such as these, see the papers by
Farris (1983) and Sober (1983a, 1983b), but also read the exchange
between Felsenstein and Sober (1986).

<b>fmix</b> output is standard: a list of equally parsimonious trees,
which will be printed as rooted or unrooted depending on which is
appropriate, and, if the user chooses, a table of the number of
changes of state required in each character. If the Wagner option is
in force for a character, it may not be possible to unambiguously
locate the places on the tree where the changes occur, as there may be
multiple possibilities. If the user selects menu option 5, a table is
printed out after each tree, showing for each branch whether there are
known to be changes in the branch, and what the states are inferred to
have been at the top end of the branch. If the inferred state is a "?"
there will be multiple equally-parsimonious assignments of states; the
user must work these out for themselves by hand.

<p>
If the Camin-Sokal parsimony method is invoked and the Ancestors
option is also used, then the program will infer, for any character
whose ancestral state is unknown ("?") whether the ancestral state 0
or 1 will give the fewest state changes. If these are tied, then it
may not be possible for the program to infer the state in the internal
nodes, and these will all be printed as ".". If this has happened and
you want to know more about the states at the internal nodes, you will
find helpful to use MOVE to display the tree and examine its interior
states, as the algorithm in MOVE shows all that can be known in this
case about the interior states, including where there is and is not
amibiguity. The algorithm in MIX gives up more easily on displaying
these states.

<p>
If the A option is not used, then the program will assume 0 as the
ancestral state for those characters following the Camin-Sokal method,
and will assume that the ancestral state is unknown for those
characters following Wagner parsimony. If any characters have unknown
ancestral states, and if the resulting tree is rooted (even by
outgroup), a table will also be printed out showing the best guesses
of which are the ancestral states in each character. You will find it
useful to understand the difference between the Camin-Sokal parsimony
criterion with unknown ancestral state and the Wagner parsimony
criterion.

<p>
If the U (User Tree) option is used and more than one tree is
supplied, the program also performs a statistical test of each of
these trees against the best tree. This test, which is a version of
the test proposed by Alan Templeton (1983) and evaluated in a test
case by me (1985a). It is closely parallel to a test using log
likelihood differences invented by Kishino and Hasegawa (1989), and
uses the mean and variance of step differences between trees, taken
across characters. If the mean is more than 1.96 standard deviations
different then the trees are declared significantly different. The
program prints out a table of the steps for each tree, the differences
of each from the highest one, the variance of that quantity as
determined by the step differences at individual characters, and a
conclusion as to whether that tree is or is not significantly worse
than the best one. It is important to understand that the test assumes
that all the binary characters are evolving independently, which is
unlikely to be true for many suites of morphological characters.

<p>
If there are more than two trees, the test done is an extension of the
KHT test, due to Shimodaira and Hasegawa (1999). They pointed out that
a correction for the number of trees was necessary, and they
introduced a resampling method to make this correction. In the version
used here the variances and covariances of the sums of steps across
characters are computed for all pairs of trees. To test whether the
difference between each tree and the best one is larger than could
have been expected if they all had the same expected number of steps,
numbers of steps for all trees are sampled with these covariances and
equal means (Shimodaira and Hasegawa's "least favorable hypothesis"),
and a P value is computed from the fraction of times the difference
between the tree's value and the lowest number of steps exceeds that
actually observed. Note that this sampling needs random numbers, and
so the program will prompt the user for a random number seed if one
has not already been supplied. With the two-tree KHT test no random
numbers are used.

<p>
In either the KHT or the SH test the program prints out a table of the
number of steps for each tree, the differences of each from the lowest
one, the variance of that quantity as determined by the differences of
the numbers of steps at individual characters, and a conclusion as to
whether that tree is or is not significantly worse than the best one.

<p>
If option 6 is left in its default state the trees found will be
written to a tree file, so that they are available to be used in other
programs. If the program finds multiple trees tied for best, all of
these are written out onto the output tree file. Each is followed by a
numerical weight in square brackets (such as [0.25000]). This is
needed when we use the trees to make a consensus tree of the results
of bootstrapping or jackknifing, to avoid overrepresenting replicates
that find many tied trees.
