<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Reads in a tree (with branch lengths if necessary) and allows you to
reroot the tree, to flip branches, to change species names and branch
lengths, and then write the result out. Can be used to convert between
rooted and unrooted trees, and to write the tree into a preliminary
version of a new XML tree file format which is under development and
which is described in the RETREE documentation web page.


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


RETREE is a tree editor. It reads in a tree, or allows the user to
construct one, and displays this tree on the screen. The user then can
specify how the tree is to be rearranged, rerooted or written out to a
file.

<p>
The input trees are in one file (with default file name intree), the
output trees are written into another (outtree). The user can reroot,
flip branches, change names of species, change or remove branch
lengths, and move around to look at various parts of the tree if it is
too large to fit on the screen. The trees can be multifurcating at any
level, although the user is warned that many PHYLIP programs still
cannot handle multifurcations above the root, or even at the root.

<p>
A major use for this program will be to change rootedness of trees so
that a rooted tree derived from one program can be fed in as an
unrooted tree to another (you are asked about this when you give the
command to write out the tree onto the tree output file). It will also
be useful for specifying the length of a branch in a tree where you
want a program like DNAML, DNAMLK, FITCH, or CONTML to hold that
branch length constant (see the L suboption of the User Tree option in
those programs. It will also be useful for changing the order of
species for purely cosmetic reasons for DRAWGRAM and DRAWTREE,
including using the Midpoint method of rooting the tree. It can also
be used to write out a tree file in the Nexus format used by Paup and
MacClade or in our XML tree file format.

<p>
This program uses graphic characters that show the tree to best
advantage on some computer systems. Its graphic characters will work
best on MSDOS systems or MSDOS windows in Windows, and to any system
whose screen or terminals emulate ANSI standard terminals such as old
Digitial VT100 terminals, Telnet programs, or VT100-compatible windows
in the X windowing system. For any other screen types, (such as
Macintosh windows) there is a generic option which does not make use
of screen graphics characters. The program will work well in those
cases, but the tree it displays will look a bit uglier.

The N (output file format) option allows the user to
specify that the tree files that are written by the program will be in
one of three formats:


<ol>


<li> 
The PHYLIP default file format (the Newick standard) used by the
programs in this package.

<li> The Nexus format defined by David Swofford and by Wayne Maddison
and David Maddison for their programs PAUP and MacClade. A tree file
written in Nexus format should be directly readable by those programs
(They also have options to read a regular PHYLIP tree file as well).

<li> 
An XML tree file format which we have defined. 

</ol> 

<p>
The XML tree file format is fairly simple. The tree file, which may
have multiple trees, is enclosed in a pair of &lt;PHYLOGENIES&gt;
... &lt;/PHYLOGENIES&gt; tags. Each tree is included in tags &lt;PHYLOGENY&gt;
... &lt;/PHYLOGENY&gt;. Each branch of the tree is enclosed in a pair of
tags &lt;CLADE&gt; ... &lt;/CLADE&gt;, which enclose the branch and all its
descendants. If the branch has a length, this is given by the LENGTH
attribute of the CLADE tag, so that the pair of tags looks like this:


&lt;CLADE LENGTH="0.09362"&gt; ... &lt;/CLADE&gt;

<p>
A tip of the tree is at the end of a branch (and hence that branch is enclosed in a pair of &lt;CLADE&gt; ... &lt;/CLADE&gt; tags). Its name is enclosed by &lt;NAME&gt; ... &lt;/NAME&gt; tags. Here is an XML tree: 

<p>
<pre>
&lt;phylogenies&gt;
  &lt;phylogeny&gt;
    &lt;clade&gt;
      &lt;clade length="0.87231"&gt;&lt;name&gt;Mouse&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/clade&gt;
      &lt;clade length="0.49807"&gt;&lt;name&gt;Bovine&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/clade&gt;
      &lt;clade length="0.39538"&gt;
        &lt;clade length="0.25930"&gt;&lt;name&gt;Gibbon&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/clade&gt;
        &lt;clade length="0.10815"&gt;
          &lt;clade length="0.24166"&gt;&lt;name&gt;Orang&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/clade&gt;
          &lt;clade length="0.04405"&gt;
            &lt;clade length="0.12322"&gt;&lt;name&gt;Gorilla&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/clade&gt;
            &lt;clade length="0.06026"&gt;
              &lt;clade length="0.13846"&gt;&lt;name&gt;Chimp&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/clade&gt;
              &lt;clade length="0.0857"&gt;&lt;name&gt;Human&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/clade&gt;
            &lt;/clade&gt;
          &lt;/clade&gt;
        &lt;/clade&gt;
      &lt;/clade&gt;
    &lt;/clade&gt;
  &lt;/phylogeny&gt;
&lt;/phylogenies&gt;

<p>
The indentation is for readability but is not part of the XML tree
standard, which ignores that kind of white space.

<p>
What programs can read an XML tree? None right now, not even PHYLIP
programs! But soon our lab's LAMARC package will have programs that
can read an XML tree. XML is rapidly becoming the standard for
representing and interchanging complex data -- it is time to have an
XML tree standard. Certain extensions are obvious (to represent the
bootstrap proportion for a branch, use BOOTP=0.83 in the CLADE tag,
for example).

<p>
There are other proposals for an XML tree standard. They have many
similarities to this one, but are not identical to it. At the moment
there is no mechanism in place for deciding between them other than
seeing which get widely used. Here are links to other proposals:

<p>
The W (screen and window Width) option specifies the width in
characters of the area which the trees will be plotted to fit
into. This is by default 80 characters so that they will fit on a
normal width terminal. The actual width of the display on the terminal
(normally 80 characters) will be regarded as a window displaying part
of the tree. Thus you could set the "plotting area" to 132 characters,
and inform the program that the screen width is 80 characters. Then
the program will display only part of the tree at any one time.
