<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Plots rooted phylogenies, cladograms, circular trees and phenograms in
a wide variety of user-controllable formats. The program is
interactive and allows previewing of the tree on PC, Macintosh, or X
Windows screens, or on Tektronix or Digital graphics terminals. Final
output can be to a file formatted for one of the drawing programs, for
a ray-tracing or VRML browser, or one at can be sent to a laser
printer (such as Postscript or PCL-compatible printers), on graphics
screens or terminals, on pen plotters or on dot matrix printers
capable of graphics.

<p>
Similar to DRAWTREE but plots rooted phylogenies. 

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

DRAWGRAM interactively plots a cladogram- or phenogram-like rooted
tree diagram, with many options including orientation of tree and
branches, style of tree, label sizes and angles, tree depth, margin
sizes, stem lengths, and placement of nodes in the tree. Particularly
if you can use your computer to preview the plot, you can very
effectively adjust the details of the plotting to get just the kind of
plot you want.

<p>
To understand the working of DRAWGRAM and DRAWTREE, you should first
read the Tree Drawing Programs web page in this documentation.

<p>
As with DRAWTREE, to run DRAWGRAM you need a compiled copy of the
program, a font file, and a tree file. The tree file has a default
name of intree. The font file has a default name of "fontfile". If
there is no file of that name, the program will ask you for the name
of a font file (we provide ones that have the names font1 through
font6). Once you decide on a favorite one of these, you could make a
copy of it and call it fontfile, and it will then be used by
default. Note that the program will get confused if the input tree
file has the number of trees on the first line of the file, so that
numbr may have to be removed.
