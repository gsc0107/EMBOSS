    Description
</H2>

Computes consensus trees by the majority-rule consensus tree method,
which also allows one to easily find the strict consensus tree. Is not
able to compute the Adams consensus tree. Trees are input in a tree
file in standard nested-parenthesis notation, which is produced by
many of the tree estimation programs in the package. This program can
be used as the final step in doing bootstrap analyses for many of the
methods in the package.


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>



<b>fconsense</b> reads a file of computer-readable trees and prints
out (and may also write out onto a file) a consensus tree. At the
moment it carries out a family of consensus tree methods called the Ml
methods (Margush and McMorris, 1981). These include strict consensus
and majority rule consensus. Basically the consensus tree consists of
monophyletic groups that occur as often as possible in the data. If a
group occurs in more than a fraction l of all the input trees it will
definitely appear in the consensus tree.

<p>
The tree printed out has at each fork a number indicating how many
times the group which consists of the species to the right of
(descended from) the fork occurred. Thus if we read in 15 trees and
find that a fork has the number 15, that group occurred in all of the
trees. The strict consensus tree consists of all groups that occurred
100% of the time, the rest of the resolution being ignored. The tree
printed out here includes groups down to 50%, and below it until the
tree is fully resolved.

<p>
The majority rule consensus tree consists of all groups that occur
more than 50% of the time. Any other percentage level between 50% and
100% can also be used, and that is why the program in effect carries
out a family of methods. You have to decide on the percentage level,
figure out for yourself what number of occurrences that would be
(e.g. 15 in the above case for 100%), and resolutely ignore any group
below that number. Do not use numbers at or below 50%, because some
groups occurring (say) 35% of the time will not be shown on the
tree. The collection of all groups that occur 35% or more of the time
may include two groups that are mutually self contradictory and cannot
appear in the same tree. In this program, as the default method I have
included groups that occur less than 50% of the time, working
downwards in their frequency of occurrence, as long as they continue
to resolve the tree and do not contradict more frequent groups. In
this respect the method is similar to the Nelson consensus method
(Nelson, 1979) as explicated by Page (1989) although it is not
identical to it.

<p>
The program can also carry out Strict consensus, Majority Rule
consensus without the extension which adds groups until the tree is
fully resolved, and other members of the Ml family, where the user
supplied the fraction of times the group must appear in the input
trees to be included in the consensus tree. For the moment the program
cannot carry out any other consensus tree method, such as Adams
consensus (Adams, 1972, 1986) or methods based on quadruples of
species (Estabrook, McMorris, and Meacham, 1985).

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


<b>fconsense</b> output is a list of the species (in the order in
which they appear in the first tree, which is the numerical order used
in the program), a list of the subsets that appear in the consensus
tree, a list of those that appeared in one or another of the
individual trees but did not occur frequently enough to get into the
consensus tree, followed by a diagram showing the consensus tree. The
lists of subsets consists of a row of symbols, each either "." or
"*". The species that are in the set are marked by "*". Every ten
species there is a blank, to help you keep track of the alignment of
columns. The order of symbols corresponds to the order of species in
the species list. Thus a set that consisted of the second, seventh,
and eighth out of 13 species would be represented by:

<pre>

          .*....**.. ...
</pre>

Note that if the trees are unrooted the final tree will have one
group, consisting of every species except the Outgroup (which by
default is the first species encountered on the first tree), which
always appears. It will not be listed in either of the lists of sets,
but it will be shown in the final tree as occurring all of the
time. This is hardly surprising: in telling the program that this
species is the outgroup we have specified that the set consisting of
all of the others is always a monophyletic set. So this is not to be
taken as interesting information, despite its dramatic appearance.

<h3>Branch Lengths on the Consensus Tree?</h3>

Note that the lengths on the tree on the output tree file are not
branch lengths but the number of times that each group appeared in the
input trees. This number is the sum of the weights of the trees in
which it appeared, so that if there are 11 trees, ten of them having
weight 0.1 and one weight 1.0, a group that appeared in the last tree
and in 6 others would be shown as appearing 1.6 times and its branch
length will be 1.6. This means that if you take the consensus tree
from the output tree file and try to draw it, the branch lengths will
be strange. I am often asked how to put the correct branch lengths on
these (this is one of our Frequently Asked Questions).

There is no simple answer to this. It depends on what "correct"
means. For example, if you have a group of species that shows up in
80% of the trees, and the branch leading to that group has average
length 0.1 among that 80%, is the "correct" length 0.1? Or is it (0.80
x 0.1)? There is no simple answer.

However, if you want to take the consensus tree as an estimate of the
true tree (rather than as an indicator of the conflicts among trees)
you may be able to use the User Tree (option U) mode of the phylogeny
program that you used, and use it to put branch lengths on that
tree. Thus, if you used DNAML, you can take the consensus tree, make
sure it is an unrooted tree, and feed that to DNAML using the original
data set (before bootstrapping) and DNAML's option U. As DNAML wants
an unrooted tree, you may have to use RETREE to make the tree unrooted
(using the W option of RETREE and choosing the unrooted option within
it). Of course you will also want to change the tree file name from
"outree" to "intree".

If you used a phylogeny program that does not infer branch lengths,
you might want to use a different one (such as FITCH or DNAML) to
infer the branch lengths, again making sure the tree is unrooted, if
the program needs that.
