<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Estimation of phylogenies by maximum likelihood using restriction
sites data (not restriction fragments but presence/absence of
individual sites). It employs the Jukes-Cantor symmetrical model of
nucleotide change, which does not allow for differences of rate
between transitions and transversions. This program is very slow.

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


This program implements a maximum likelihood method for restriction
sites data (not restriction fragment data). This program is one of the
slowest programs in this package, and can be very tedious to run. It
is possible to have the program search for the maximum likelihood
tree. It will be more practical for some users (those that do not have
fast machines) to use the U (User Tree) option, which takes less run
time, optimizing branch lengths and computing likelihoods for
particular tree topologies suggested by the user. The model used here
is essentially identical to that used by Smouse and Li (1987) who give
explicit expressions for computing the likelihood for three-species
trees. It does not place prior probabilities on trees as they do. The
present program extends their approach to multiple species by a
technique which, while it does not give explicit expressions for
likelihoods, does enable their computation and the iterative
improvement of branch lengths. It also allows for multiple restriction
enzymes. The algorithm has been described in a paper (Felsenstein,
1992). Another relevant paper is that of DeBry and Slade (1985).

<p>
The assumptions of the present model are: 

<ol>

<li>
Each restriction site evolves independently. 

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>
Each site undergoes substitution at an expected rate which we specify. 

<li>
Substitutions consist of replacement of a nucleotide by one of the
other three nucleotides, chosen at random.

</ol>

<p>
Note that if the existing base is, say, an A, the chance of it being
replaced by a G is 1/3, and so is the chance that it is replaced by a
T. This means that there can be no difference in the (expected) rate
of transitions and transversions. Users who are upset at this might
ponder the fact that a version allowing different rates of transitions
and transversions would run an estimated 16 times slower. If it also
allowed for unequal frequencies of the four bases, it would run about
300,000 times slower! For the moment, until a better method is
available, I guess I'll stick with this one!

<p>
Subject to these assumptions, the program is an approximately correct
maximum likelihood method.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

<b>frestml</b> input is fairly standard, with one addition. As usual
the first line of the file gives the number of species and the number
of sites, but there is also a third number, which is the number of
different restriction enzymes that were used to detect the restriction
sites. Thus a data set with 10 species and 35 different sites,
representing digestion with 4 different enzymes, would have the first
line of the data file look like this:

<p>
<pre>

   10   35    4

</pre>

<p>
The first line of the data file will also contain a letter W following
these numbers (and separated from them by a space) if the Weights
option is being used. As with all programs using the weights option, a
line or lines must then follow, before the data, with the weights for
each site.

<p>
The site data are in standard form. Each species starts with a species
name whose maximum length is given by the constant "nmlngth" (whose
value in the program as distributed is 10 characters). The name
should, as usual, be padded out to that length with blanks if
necessary. The sites data then follows, one character per site (any
blanks will be skipped and ignored). Like the DNA and protein sequence
data, the restriction sites data may be either in the "interleaved"
form or the "sequential" form. Note that if you are analyzing
restriction sites data with the programs DOLLOP or MIX or other
discrete character programs, at the moment those programs do not use
the "aligned" or "interleaved" data format. Therefore you may want to
avoid that format when you have restriction sites data that you will
want to feed into those programs.

<p>
The presence of a site is indicated by a "+" and the absence by a
"-". I have also allowed the use of "1" and "0" as synonyms for "+"
and "-", for compatibility with MIX and DOLLOP which do not allow "+"
and "-". If the presence of the site is unknown (for example, if the
DNA containing it has been deleted so that one does not know whether
it would have contained the site) then the state "?" can be used to
indicate that the state of this site is unknown.

<p>
User-defined trees may follow the data in the usual way. The trees
must be unrooted, which means that at their base they must have a
trifurcation.
