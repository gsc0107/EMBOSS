    Description
</H2>

Finds all most parsimonious phylogenies for discrete-character data
with two states, for the Dollo or polymorphism parsimony criteria
using the branch-and-bound method of exact search. May be impractical
(depending on the data) for more than 10-11 species.

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

DOLPENNY is a program that will find all of the most parsimonious
trees implied by your data when the Dollo or polymorphism parsimony
criteria are employed. It does so not by examining all possible trees,
but by using the more sophisticated "branch and bound" algorithm, a
standard computer science search strategy first applied to
phylogenetic inference by Hendy and Penny (1982). (J. S. Farris
[personal communication, 1975] had also suggested that this strategy,
which is well-known in computer science, might be applied to
phylogenies, but he did not publish this suggestion).

<p>
There is, however, a price to be paid for the certainty that one has
found all members of the set of most parsimonious trees. The problem
of finding these has been shown (Graham and Foulds, 1982; Day, 1983)
to be NP-complete, which is equivalent to saying that there is no fast
algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the problem in all cases (for a
discussion of NP-completeness, see the Scientific American article by
Lewis and Papadimitriou, 1978). The result is that this program,
despite its algorithmic sophistication, is VERY SLOW.

<p>
The program should be slower than the other tree-building programs in
the package, but useable up to about ten species. Above this it will
bog down rapidly, but exactly when depends on the data and on how much
computer time you have (it may be more effective in the hands of
someone who can let a microcomputer grind all night than for someone
who has the "benefit" of paying for time on the campus mainframe
computer). IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO GET A FEEL FOR HOW LONG THE
PROGRAM WILL TAKE ON YOUR DATA. This can be done by running it on
subsets of the species, increasing the number of species in the run
until you either are able to treat the full data set or know that the
program will take unacceptably long on it. (Making a plot of the
logarithm of run time against species number may help to project run
times).


<h3>The Algorithm</h3>

<p>
The search strategy used by DOLPENNY starts by making a tree
consisting of the first two species (the first three if the tree is to
be unrooted). Then it tries to add the next species in all possible
places (there are three of these). For each of the resulting trees it
evaluates the number of losses. It adds the next species to each of
these, again in all possible spaces. If this process would continue it
would simply generate all possible trees, of which there are a very
large number even when the number of species is moderate (34,459,425
with 10 species). Actually it does not do this, because the trees are
generated in a particular order and some of them are never generated.

<p>
Actually the order in which trees are generated is not quite as
implied above, but is a "depth-first search". This means that first
one adds the third species in the first possible place, then the
fourth species in its first possible place, then the fifth and so on
until the first possible tree has been produced. Its number of steps
is evaluated. Then one "backtracks" by trying the alternative
placements of the last species. When these are exhausted one tries the
next placement of the next-to-last species. The order of placement in
a depth-first search is like this for a four-species case (parentheses
enclose monophyletic groups):

<p>
<pre>
     Make tree of first two species     (A,B)
          Add C in first place     ((A,B),C)
               Add D in first place     (((A,D),B),C)
               Add D in second place     ((A,(B,D)),C)
               Add D in third place     (((A,B),D),C)
               Add D in fourth place     ((A,B),(C,D))
               Add D in fifth place     (((A,B),C),D)
          Add C in second place: ((A,C),B)
               Add D in first place     (((A,D),C),B)
               Add D in second place     ((A,(C,D)),B)
               Add D in third place     (((A,C),D),B)
               Add D in fourth place     ((A,C),(B,D))
               Add D in fifth place     (((A,C),B),D)
          Add C in third place     (A,(B,C))
               Add D in first place     ((A,D),(B,C))
               Add D in second place     (A,((B,D),C))
               Add D in third place     (A,(B,(C,D)))
               Add D in fourth place     (A,((B,C),D))
               Add D in fifth place     ((A,(B,C)),D)
</pre>

<p>
Among these fifteen trees you will find all of the four-species rooted
bifurcating trees, each exactly once (the parentheses each enclose a
monophyletic group). As displayed above, the backtracking depth-first
search algorithm is just another way of producing all possible trees
one at a time. The branch and bound algorithm consists of this with
one change. As each tree is constructed, including the partial trees
such as (A,(B,C)), its number of losses (or retentions of
polymorphism) is evaluated.

<p>
The point of this is that if a previously-found tree such as
((A,B),(C,D)) required fewer losses, then we know that there is no
point in even trying to add D to ((A,C),B). We have computed the bound
that enables us to cut off a whole line of inquiry (in this case five
trees) and avoid going down that particular branch any farther.

<p>
The branch-and-bound algorithm thus allows us to find all most
parsimonious trees without generating all possible trees. How much of
a saving this is depends strongly on the data. For very clean (nearly
"Hennigian") data, it saves much time, but on very messy data it will
still take a very long time.

<p>
The algorithm in the program differs from the one outlined here in
some essential details: it investigates possibilities in the order of
their apparent promise. This applies to the order of addition of
species, and to the places where they are added to the tree. After the
first two-species tree is constructed, the program tries adding each
of the remaining species in turn, each in the best possible place it
can find. Whichever of those species adds (at a minimum) the most
additional steps is taken to be the one to be added next to the
tree. When it is added, it is added in turn to places which cause the
fewest additional steps to be added. This sounds a bit complex, but it
is done with the intention of eliminating regions of the search of all
possible trees as soon as possible, and lowering the bound on tree
length as quickly as possible.

<p>
The program keeps a list of all the most parsimonious trees found so
far. Whenever it finds one that has fewer losses than these, it clears
out the list and restarts the list with that tree. In the process the
bound tightens and fewer possibilities need be investigated. At the
end the list contains all the shortest trees. These are then printed
out. It should be mentioned that the program CLIQUE for finding all
largest cliques also works by branch-and-bound. Both problems are
NP-complete but for some reason CLIQUE runs far faster. Although their
worst-case behavior is bad for both programs, those worst cases occur
far more frequently in parsimony problems than in compatibility
problems.


<h3>Controlling Run Times</h3>

<p>
Among the quantities available to be set at the beginning of a run of
DOLPENNY, two (howoften and howmany) are of particular importance. As
DOLPENNY goes along it will keep count of how many trees it has
examined. Suppose that howoften is 100 and howmany is 300, the default
settings. Every time 100 trees have been examined, DOLPENNY will print
out a line saying how many multiples of 100 trees have now been
examined, how many steps the most parsimonious tree found so far has,
how many trees of with that number of steps have been found, and a
very rough estimate of what fraction of all trees have been looked at
so far.

<p>
When the number of these multiples printed out reaches the number
howmany (say 1000), the whole algorithm aborts and prints out that it
has not found all most parsimonious trees, but prints out what is has
got so far anyway. These trees need not be any of the most
parsimonious trees: they are simply the most parsimonious ones found
so far. By setting the product (howoften X howmany) large you can make
the algorithm less likely to abort, but then you risk getting bogged
down in a gigantic computation. You should adjust these constants so
that the program cannot go beyond examining the number of trees you
are reasonably willing to pay for (or wait for). In their initial
setting the program will abort after looking at 100,000
trees. Obviously you may want to adjust howoften in order to get more
or fewer lines of intermediate notice of how many trees have been
looked at so far. Of course, in small cases you may never even reach
the first multiple of howoften and nothing will be printed out except
some headings and then the final trees.

<p>
The indication of the approximate percentage of trees searched so far
will be helpful in judging how much farther you would have to go to
get the full search. Actually, since that fraction is the fraction of
the set of all possible trees searched or ruled out so far, and since
the search becomes progressively more efficient, the approximate
fraction printed out will usually be an underestimate of how far along
the program is, sometimes a serious underestimate.

<p>
A constant that affects the result is "maxtrees", which controls the
maximum number of trees that can be stored. Thus if "maxtrees" is 25,
and 32 most parsimonious trees are found, only the first 25 of these
are stored and printed out. If "maxtrees" is increased, the program
does not run any slower but requires a little more intermediate
storage space. I recommend that "maxtrees" be kept as large as you
can, provided you are willing to look at an output with that many
trees on it! Initially, "maxtrees" is set to 100 in the distribution
copy.


<h3>Methods and Options</h3>

<p>
The counting of the length of trees is done by an algorithm nearly
identical to the corresponding algorithms in DOLLOP, and thus the
remainder of this document will be nearly identical to the DOLLOP
document. The Dollo parsimony method was first suggested in print in
verbal form by Le Quesne (1974) and was first well-specified by Farris
(1977). The method is named after Louis Dollo since he was one of the
first to assert that in evolution it is harder to gain a complex
feature than to lose it. The algorithm explains the presence of the
state 1 by allowing up to one forward change 0-->1 and as many
reversions 1-->0 as are necessary to explain the pattern of states
seen. The program attempts to minimize the number of 1-->0 reversions
necessary.

<p>
The assumptions of this method are in effect: 

<ol>

<li>
We know which state is the ancestral one (state 0). 

<li>
The characters are evolving independently. 

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>
The probability of a forward change (0--&gt;1) is small over the
evolutionary times involved.

<li>
The probability of a reversion (1--&gt;0) is also small, but still far
larger than the probability of a forward change, so that many
reversions are easier to envisage than even one extra forward change.

<li>
Retention of polymorphism for both states (0 and 1) is highly improbable. 

<li>
The lengths of the segments of the true tree are not so unequal that
two changes in a long segment are as probable as one in a short
segment.

</ol>

<p>
That these are the assumptions is established in several of my papers
(1973a, 1978b, 1979, 1981b, 1983). For an opposing view arguing that
the parsimony methods make no substantive assumptions such as these,
see the papers by Farris (1983) and Sober (1983a, 1983b), but also
read the exchange between Felsenstein and Sober (1986).

<p>
One problem can arise when using additive binary recoding to represent
a multistate character as a series of two-state characters. Unlike the
Camin-Sokal, Wagner, and Polymorphism methods, the Dollo method can
reconstruct ancestral states which do not exist. An example is given
in my 1979 paper. It will be necessary to check the output to make
sure that this has not occurred.

<p>
The polymorphism parsimony method was first used by me, and the
results published (without a clear specification of the method) by
Inger (1967). The method was published by Farris (1978a) and by me
(1979). The method assumes that we can explain the pattern of states
by no more than one origination (0--&gt;1) of state 1, followed by
retention of polymorphism along as many segments of the tree as are
necessary, followed by loss of state 0 or of state 1 where
necessary. The program tries to minimize the total number of
polymorphic characters, where each polymorphism is counted once for
each segment of the tree in which it is retained.

<p>
The assumptions of the polymorphism parsimony method are in effect: 

<ol>

<li>
The ancestral state (state 0) is known in each character. 

<li>
The characters are evolving independently of each other. 

<li>
Different lineages are evolving independently. 

<li>
Forward change (0--&gt;1) is highly improbable over the length of time
involved in the evolution of the group.

<li>
Retention of polymorphism is also improbable, but far more probable
that forward change, so that we can more easily envisage much
polymorhism than even one additional forward change.

<li>
Once state 1 is reached, reoccurrence of state 0 is very improbable,
much less probable than multiple retentions of polymorphism.

<li>
The lengths of segments in the true tree are not so unequal that we
can more easily envisage retention events occurring in both of two
long segments than one retention in a short segment.


</ol>

<p>
That these are the assumptions of parsimony methods has been
documented in a series of papers of mine: (1973a, 1978b, 1979, 1981b,
1983b, 1988b). For an opposing view arguing that the parsimony methods
make no substantive assumptions such as these, see the papers by
Farris (1983) and Sober (1983a, 1983b), but also read the exchange
between Felsenstein and Sober (1986).

<b>fdolpenny</b> output format is standard. It includes a rooted
tree and, if the user selects option 4, a table of the numbers of
reversions or retentions of polymorphism necessary in each
character. If any of the ancestral states has been specified to be
unknown, a table of reconstructed ancestral states is also
provided. When reconstructing the placement of forward changes and
reversions under the Dollo method, keep in mind that each polymorphic
state in the input data will require one "last minute" reversion. This
is included in the tabulated counts. Thus if we have both states 0 and
1 at a tip of the tree the program will assume that the lineage had
state 1 up to the last minute, and then state 0 arose in that
population by reversion, without loss of state 1.

<p>
A table is available to be printed out after each tree, showing for
each branch whether there are known to be changes in the branch, and
what the states are inferred to have been at the top end of the
branch. If the inferred state is a "?" there will be multiple
equally-parsimonious assignments of states; the user must work these
out for themselves by hand.

<p>
If the A option is used, then the program will infer, for any
character whose ancestral state is unknown ("?") whether the ancestral
state 0 or 1 will give the best tree. If these are tied, then it may
not be possible for the program to infer the state in the internal
nodes, and these will all be printed as ".". If this has happened and
you want to know more about the states at the internal nodes, you will
find helpful to use DOLMOVE to display the tree and examine its
interior states, as the algorithm in DOLMOVE shows all that can be
known in this case about the interior states, including where there is
and is not amibiguity. The algorithm in DOLPENNY gives up more easily
on displaying these states.

<p>
If option 6 is left in its default state the trees found will be
written to a tree file, so that they are available to be used in other
programs. If the program finds multiple trees tied for best, all of
these are written out onto the output tree file. Each is followed by a
numerical weight in square brackets (such as [0.25000]). This is
needed when we use the trees to make a consensus tree of the results
of bootstrapping or jackknifing, to avoid overrepresenting replicates
that find many tied trees.
