<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Interactive construction of phylogenies from discrete character data
with two states (0 and 1) using the Dollo or polymorphism parsimony
criteria. Evaluates parsimony and compatibility criteria for those
phylogenies and displays reconstructed states throughout the
tree. This can be used to find parsimony or compatibility estimates by
hand. 



<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


DOLMOVE is an interactive parsimony program which uses the Dollo and
Polymorphism parsimony criteria. It is inspired on Wayne Maddison and
David Maddison's marvellous program MacClade, which is written for
Apple MacIntosh computers. DOLMOVE reads in a data set which is
prepared in almost the same format as one for the Dollo and
polymorhism parsimony program DOLLOP. It allows the user to choose an
initial tree, and displays this tree on the screen. The user can look
at different characters and the way their states are distributed on
that tree, given the most parsimonious reconstruction of state changes
for that particular tree. The user then can specify how the tree is to
be rearraranged, rerooted or written out to a file. By looking at
different rearrangements of the tree the user can manually search for
the most parsimonious tree, and can get a feel for how different
characters are affected by changes in the tree topology.

<p>
This program is compatible with fewer computer systems than the other
programs in PHYLIP. It can be adapted to PCDOS systems or to any
system whose screen or terminals emulate DEC VT100 terminals (such as
Telnet programs for logging in to remote computers over a TCP/IP
network, VT100-compatible windows in the X windowing system, and any
terminal compatible with ANSI standard terminals). For any other
screen types, there is a generic option which does not make use of
screen graphics characters to display the character states. This will
be less effective, as the states will be less easy to see when
displayed.

<b>fdolmove</b> output:

<p>

If the A option is used, then the program will infer, for any
character whose ancestral state is unknown ("?") whether the ancestral
state 0 or 1 will give the fewest changes (according to the criterion
in use). If these are tied, then it may not be possible for the
program to infer the state in the internal nodes, and many of these
will be shown as "?". If the A option is not used, then the program
will assume 0 as the ancestral state.

<p>
When reconstructing the placement of forward changes and reversions
under the Dollo method, keep in mind that each polymorphic state in
the input data will require one "last minute" reversion. This is
included in the counts. Thus if we have both states 0 and 1 at a tip
of the tree the program will assume that the lineage had state 1 up to
the last minute, and then state 0 arose in that population by
reversion, without loss of state 1.

<p>
When DOLMOVE calculates the number of characters compatible with the
tree, it will take the F option into account and count the multistate
characters as units, counting a character as compatible with the tree
only when all of the binary characters corresponding to it are
compatible with the tree.
