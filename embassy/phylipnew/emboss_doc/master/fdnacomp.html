<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Estimates phylogenies from nucleic acid sequence data using the
compatibility criterion, which searches for the largest number of
sites which could have all states (nucleotides) uniquely evolved on
the same tree. Compatibility is particularly appropriate when sites
vary greatly in their rates of evolution, but we do not know in
advance which are the less reliable ones.



<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


<p>
This program implements the compatibility method for DNA sequence
data. For a four-state character without a character-state tree, as in
DNA sequences, the usual clique theorems cannot be applied. The
approach taken in this program is to directly evaluate each tree
topology by counting how many substitutions are needed in each site,
comparing this to the minimum number that might be needed (one less
than the number of bases observed at that site), and then evaluating
the number of sites which achieve the minimum number. This is the
evaluation of the tree (the number of compatible sites), and the
topology is chosen so as to maximize that number.

<p>
Compatibility methods originated with Le Quesne's (1969) suggestion
that one ought to look for trees supported by the largest number of
perfectly fitting (compatible) characters. Fitch (1975) showed by
counterexample that one could not use the pairwise compatibility
methods used in CLIQUE to discover the largest clique of jointly
compatible characters.

<p>
The assumptions of this method are similar to those of CLIQUE. In a
paper in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society (1981b) I
discuss this matter extensively. In effect, the assumptions are that:

<ol>

<li>
Each character evolves independently. 

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>
The ancestral base at each site is unknown. 

<li>
The rates of change in most sites over the time spans involved in the the divergence of the group are very small. 

<li>
A few of the sites have very high rates of change. 

<li>
We do not know in advance which are the high and which the low rate sites. 

</ol>

<p>
That these are the assumptions of compatibility methods has been
documented in a series of papers of mine: (1973a, 1978b, 1979, 1981b,
1983b, 1988b). For an opposing view arguing that arguments such as
mine are invalid and that parsimony (and perhaps compatibility)
methods make no substantive assumptions such as these, see the papers
by Farris (1983) and Sober (1983a, 1983b, 1988), but also read the
exchange between Felsenstein and Sober (1986).

<p>
There is, however, some reason to believe that the present criterion
is not the proper way to correct for the presence of some sites with
high rates of change in nucleotide sequence data. It can be argued
that sites showing more than two nucleotide states, even if those are
compatible with the other sites, are also candidates for sites with
high rates of change. It might then be more proper to use DNAPARS with
the Threshold option with a threshold value of 2.

<p>
Change from an occupied site to a gap is counted as one
change. Reversion from a gap to an occupied site is allowed and is
also counted as one change. Note that this in effect assumes that a
gap N bases long is N separate events. This may be an
overcorrection. When we have nonoverlapping gaps, we could instead
code a gap as a single event by changing all but the first "-" in the
gap into "?" characters. In this way only the first base of the gap
causes the program to infer a change.

<p>
If the U (User Tree) option is used and more than one tree is
supplied, the program also performs a statistical test of each of
these trees against the one with highest likelihood. If there are two
user trees, the test done is one which is due to Kishino and Hasegawa
(1989), a version of a test originally introduced by Templeton
(1983). In this implementation it uses the mean and variance of
weighted compatibility differences between trees, taken across
sites. If the two trees compatibilities are more than 1.96 standard
deviations different then the trees are declared significantly
different.

<p>
If there are more than two trees, the test done is an extension of the
KHT test, due to Shimodaira and Hasegawa (1999). They pointed out that
a correction for the number of trees was necessary, and they
introduced a resampling method to make this correction. In the version
used here the variances and covariances of the sum of weighted
compatibilities of sites are computed for all pairs of trees. To test
whether the difference between each tree and the best one is larger
than could have been expected if they all had the same expected
compatibility, compatibilities for all trees are sampled with these
covariances and equal means (Shimodaira and Hasegawa's "least
favorable hypothesis"), and a P value is computed from the fraction of
times the difference between the tree's value and the highest
compatibility exceeds that actually observed. Note that this sampling
needs random numbers, and so the program will prompt the user for a
random number seed if one has not already been supplied. With the
two-tree KHT test no random numbers are used.

<p>
In either the KHT or the SH test the program prints out a table of the
compatibility of each tree, the differences of each from the highest
one, the variance of that quantity as determined by the compatibility
differences at individual sites, and a conclusion as to whether that
tree is or is not significantly worse than the best one.

<p>
The algorithm is a straightforward modification of DNAPARS, but with
some extra machinery added to calculate, as each species is added, how
many base changes are the minimum which could be required at that
site. The program runs fairly quickly.

<b>fdnacomp</b> output is standard: if option 1 is toggled on, the
data is printed out, with the convention that "." means "the same as
in the first species". Then comes a list of equally parsimonious
trees, and (if option 2 is toggled on) a table of the number of
changes of state required in each character. If option 5 is toggled
on, a table is printed out after each tree, showing for each branch
whether there are known to be changes in the branch, and what the
states are inferred to have been at the top end of the branch. If the
inferred state is a "?" or one of the IUB ambiguity symbols, there
will be multiple equally-parsimonious assignments of states; the user
must work these out for themselves by hand. A "?" in the reconstructed
states means that in addition to one or more bases, a gap may or may
not be present. If option 6 is left in its default state the trees
found will be written to a tree file, so that they are available to be
used in other programs. If the program finds multiple trees tied for
best, all of these are written out onto the output tree file. Each is
followed by a numerical weight in square brackets (such as
[0.25000]). This is needed when we use the trees to make a consensus
tree of the results of bootstrapping or jackknifing, to avoid
overrepresenting replicates that find many tied trees.
