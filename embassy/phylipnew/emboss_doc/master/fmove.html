    Description
</H2>

Interactive construction of phylogenies from discrete character data
with two states (0 and 1). Evaluates parsimony and compatibility
criteria for those phylogenies and displays reconstructed states
throughout the tree. This can be used to find parsimony or
compatibility estimates by hand.

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

MOVE is an interactive parsimony program, inspired by Wayne Maddison
and David Maddison's marvellous program MacClade, which is written for
Apple Macintosh computers. MOVE reads in a data set which is prepared
in almost the same format as one for the mixed method parsimony
program MIX. It allows the user to choose an initial tree, and
displays this tree on the screen. The user can look at different
characters and the way their states are distributed on that tree,
given the most parsimonious reconstruction of state changes for that
particular tree. The user then can specify how the tree is to be
rearraranged, rerooted or written out to a file. By looking at
different rearrangements of the tree the user can manually search for
the most parsimonious tree, and can get a feel for how different
characters are affected by changes in the tree topology.

<p>
This program is compatible with fewer computer systems than the other
programs in PHYLIP. It can be adapted to MSDOS systems or to any
system whose screen or terminals emulate DEC VT100 terminals (such as
Telnet programs for logging in to remote computers over a TCP/IP
network, VT100-compatible windows in the X windowing system, and any
terminal compatible with ANSI standard terminals). For any other
screen types, there is a generic option which does not make use of
screen graphics characters to display the character states. This will
be less effective, as the states will be less easy to see when
displayed.

<p>
MOVE uses as its numerical criterion the Wagner and Camin-Sokal
parsimony methods in mixture, where each character can have its method
specified separately. The program defaults to carrying out Wagner
parsimony.

<p>
The Camin-Sokal parsimony method explains the data by assuming that
changes 0 --&gt; 1 are allowed but not changes 1 --&gt; 0. Wagner parsimony
allows both kinds of changes. (This under the assumption that 0 is the
ancestral state, though the program allows reassignment of the
ancestral state, in which case we must reverse the state numbers 0 and
1 throughout this discussion). The criterion is to find the tree which
requires the minimum number of changes. The Camin- Sokal method is due
to Camin and Sokal (1965) and the Wagner method to Eck and Dayhoff
(1966) and to Kluge and Farris (1969).

<p>
Here are the assumptions of these two methods: 

<ol>

<li>
Ancestral states are known (Camin-Sokal) or unknown (Wagner). 

<li>
Different characters evolve independently. 

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>
Changes 0 --&gt; 1 are much more probable than changes 1 --&gt; 0
(Camin-Sokal) or equally probable (Wagner).

<li>
Both of these kinds of changes are a priori improbable over the
evolutionary time spans involved in the differentiation of the group
in question.

<li>
Other kinds of evolutionary event such as retention of polymorphism
are far less probable than 0 --&gt; 1 changes.

<li>
Rates of evolution in different lineages are sufficiently low that two
changes in a long segment of the tree are far less probable than one
change in a short segment.

</ol>

<p>
That these are the assumptions of parsimony methods has been
documented in a series of papers of mine: (1973a, 1978b, 1979, 1981b,
1983b, 1988b). For an opposing view arguing that the parsimony methods
make no substantive assumptions such as these, see the papers by
Farris (1983) and Sober (1983a, 1983b), but also read the exchange
between Felsenstein and Sober (1986).
