    Description
</H2>

Computes a distance measure for protein sequences, using maximum
likelihood estimates based on the Dayhoff PAM matrix, the JTT matrix
model, the PBM model, Kimura's 1983 approximation to these, or a model
based on the genetic code plus a constraint on changing to a different
category of amino acid. The distances can also be corrected for
gamma-distributed and gamma-plus-invariant-sites-distributed rates of
change in different sites. Rates of evolution can vary among sites in
a prespecified way, and also according to a Hidden Markov model. The
program can also make a table of percentage similarity among
sequences. The distances can be used in the distance matrix programs.


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


This program uses protein sequences to compute a distance matrix,
under four different models of amino acid replacement. It can also
compute a table of similarity between the amino acid sequences. The
distance for each pair of species estimates the total branch length
between the two species, and can be used in the distance matrix
programs FITCH, KITSCH or NEIGHBOR. This is an alternative to use of
the sequence data itself in the parsimony program PROTPARS.

<p>
The program reads in protein sequences and writes an output file
containing the distance matrix or similarity table. The five models of
amino acid substitution are one which is based on the Jones, Taylor
and Thornton (1992) model of amino acid change, the PMB model
(Veerassamy, Smith and Tillier, 2004) which is derived from the Blocks
database of conserved protein motifs, one based on the PAM matrixes of
Margaret Dayhoff, one due to Kimura (1983) which approximates it based
simply on the fraction of similar amino acids, and one based on a
model in which the amino acids are divided up into groups, with change
occurring based on the genetic code but with greater difficulty of
changing between groups. The program correctly takes into account a
variety of sequence ambiguities.

<p>
The five methods are: 

<p>
(1) The Dayhoff PAM matrix. This uses Dayhoff's PAM 001 matrix from
Dayhoff (1979), page 348. The PAM model is an empirical one that
scales probabilities of change from one amino acid to another in terms
of a unit which is an expected 1% change between two amino acid
sequences. The PAM 001 matrix is used to make a transition probability
matrix which allows prediction of the probability of changing from any
one amino acid to any other, and also predicts equilibrium amino acid
composition. The program assumes that these probabilities are correct
and bases its computations of distance on them. The distance that is
computed is scaled in units of expected fraction of amino acids
changed. This is a unit such that 1.0 is 100 PAM's.

<p>
(2) The Jones-Taylor-Thornton model. This is similar to the Dayhoff
PAM model, except that it is based on a recounting of the number of
observed changes in amino acids by Jones, Taylor, and Thornton
(1992). They used a much larger sample of protein sequences than did
Dayhoff. The distance is scaled in units of the expected fraction of
amino acids changed (100 PAM's). Because its sample is so much larger
this model is to be preferred over the original Dayhoff PAM model. It
is the default model in this program.

<p>
(3) The PMB (Probability Matrix from Blocks) model. This is derived
using the Blocks database of conserved protein motifs. It will be
described in a paper by Veerassamy, Smith and Tillier
(2004). Elisabeth Tillier kindly made the matrices available for this
model.

<p>
(4) Kimura's distance. This is a rough-and-ready distance formula for
approximating PAM distance by simply measuring the fraction of amino
acids, p, that differs between two sequences and computing the
distance as (Kimura, 1983)

     D = - loge ( 1 - p - 0.2 p2 ). 

This is very quick to do but has some obvious limitations. It does not take into account which amino acids differ or to what amino acids they change, so some information is lost. The units of the distance measure are fraction of amino acids differing, as also in the case of the PAM distance. If the fraction of amino acids differing gets larger than 0.8541 the distance becomes infinite. 

<p>
(5) The Categories distance. This is my own concoction. I imagined a
nucleotide sequence changing according to Kimura's 2-parameter model,
with the exception that some changes of amino acids are less likely
than others. The amino acids are grouped into a series of
categories. Any base change that does not change which category the
amino acid is in is allowed, but if an amino acid changes category
this is allowed only a certain fraction of the time. The fraction is
called the "ease" and there is a parameter for it, which is 1.0 when
all changes are allowed and near 0.0 when changes between categories
are nearly impossible.

<p>
In this option I have allowed the user to select the
Transition/Transversion ratio, which of several genetic codes to use,
and which categorization of amino acids to use. There are three of
them, a somewhat random sample:

<ol>

<li>
The George-Hunt-Barker (1988) classification of amino acids, 

<li>
A classification provided by my colleague Ben Hall when I asked him for one, 

<li>
One I found in an old "baby biochemistry" book (Conn and Stumpf,
1963), which contains most of the biochemistry I was ever taught, and
all that I ever learned.

</ol>

<p>
Interestingly enough, all of them are consisten with the same linear
ordering of amino acids, which they divide up in different ways. For
the Categories model I have set as default the George/Hunt/Barker
classification with the "ease" parameter set to 0.457 which is
approximately the value implied by the empirical rates in the Dayhoff
PAM matrix.

<p>
The method uses, as I have noted, Kimura's (1980) 2-parameter model of
DNA change. The Kimura "2-parameter" model allows for a difference
between transition and transversion rates. Its transition probability
matrix for a short interval of time is:

<p>
<pre>

              To:     A        G        C        T
                   ---------------------------------
               A  | 1-a-2b     a         b       b
       From:   G  |   a      1-a-2b      b       b
               C  |   b        b       1-a-2b    a
               T  |   b        b         a     1-a-2b

</pre>


<p>
where a is u dt, the product of the rate of transitions per unit time
and dt is the length dt of the time interval, and b is v dt, the
product of half the rate of transversions (i.e., the rate of a
specific transversion) and the length dt of the time interval.

<p>
Each distance that is calculated is an estimate, from that particular
pair of species, of the divergence time between those two species. The
Kimura distance is straightforward to compute. The other two are
considerably slower, and they look at all positions, and find that
distance which makes the likelihood highest. This likelihood is in
effect the length of the internal branch in a two-species tree that
connects these two species. Its likelihood is just the product, under
the model, of the probabilities of each position having the (one or)
two amino acids that are actually found. This is fairly slow to
compute.

<p>
The computation proceeds from an eigenanalysis (spectral
decomposition) of the transition probability matrix. In the case of
the PAM 001 matrix the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are precomputed
and are hard-coded into the program in over 400 statements. In the
case of the Categories model the program computes the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors itself, which will add a delay. But the delay is
independent of the number of species as the calculation is done only
once, at the outset.

<p>
The actual algorithm for estimating the distance is in both cases a
bisection algorithm which tries to find the point at which the
derivative os the likelihood is zero. Some of the kinds of ambiguous
amino acids like "glx" are correctly taken into account. However, gaps
are treated as if they are unkown nucleotides, which means those
positions get dropped from that particular comparison. However, they
are not dropped from the whole analysis. You need not eliminate
regions containing gaps, as long as you are reasonably sure of the
alignment there.

<p>
Note that there is an assumption that we are looking at all positions,
including those that have not changed at all. It is important not to
restrict attention to some positions based on whether or not they have
changed; doing that would bias the distances by making them too large,
and that in turn would cause the distances to misinterpret the meaning
of those positions that had changed.

<p>
The program can now correct distances for unequal rates of change at
different amino acid positions. This correction, which was introduced
for DNA sequences by Jin and Nei (1990), assumes that the distribution
of rates of change among amino acid positions follows a Gamma
distribution. The user is asked for the value of a parameter that
determines the amount of variation of rates among amino acid
positions. Instead of the more widely-known coefficient alpha,
PROTDIST uses the coefficient of variation (ratio of the standard
deviation to the mean) of rates among amino acid positions. . So if
there is 20% variation in rates, the CV is is 0.20. The square of the
C.V. is also the reciprocal of the better-known "shape parameter",
alpha, of the Gamma distribution, so in this case the shape parameter
alpha = 1/(0.20*0.20) = 25. If you want to achieve a particular value
of alpha, such as 10, you will want to use a CV of 1/sqrt(100) = 1/10
= 0.1.

<p>
In addition to the five distance calculations, the program can also
compute a table of similarities between amino acid sequences. These
values are the fractions of amino acid positions identical between the
sequences. The diagonal values are 1.0000. No attempt is made to count
similarity of nonidentical amino acids, so that no credit is given for
having (for example) different hydrophobic amino acids at the
corresponding positions in the two sequences. This option has been
requested by many users, who need it for descriptive purposes. It is
not intended that the table be used for inferring the tree.

<b>fprotdist</b> output contains on its first line the number of
species. The distance matrix is then printed in standard form, with
each species starting on a new line with the species name, followed by
the distances to the species in order. These continue onto a new line
after every nine distances. The distance matrix is square with zero
distances on the diagonal. In general the format of the distance
matrix is such that it can serve as input to any of the distance
matrix programs.

<p>
If the similarity table is selected, the table that is produced is not
in a format that can be used as input to the distance matrix
programs. it has a heading, and the species names are also put at the
tops of the columns of the table (or rather, the first 8 characters of
each species name is there, the other two characters omitted to save
space). There is not an option to put the table into a format that can
be read by the distance matrix programs, nor is there one to make it
into a table of fractions of difference by subtracting the similarity
values from 1. This is done deliberately to make it more difficult for
the use to use these values to construct trees. The similarity values
are not corrected for multiple changes, and their use to construct
trees (even after converting them to fractions of difference) would be
wrong, as it would lead to severe conflict between the distant pairs
of sequences and the close pairs of sequences.

<p>
If the option to print out the data is selected, the output file will
precede the data by more complete information on the input and the
menu selections. The output file begins by giving the number of
species and the number of characters, and the identity of the distance
measure that is being used.

<p>
In the Categories model of substitution, the distances printed out are
scaled in terms of expected numbers of substitutions, counting both
transitions and transversions but not replacements of a base by
itself, and scaled so that the average rate of change is set to
1.0. For the Dayhoff PAM and Kimura models the distance are scaled in
terms of the expected numbers of amino acid substitutions per site. Of
course, when a branch is twice as long this does not mean that there
will be twice as much net change expected along it, since some of the
changes may occur in the same site and overlie or even reverse each
other. The branch lengths estimates here are in terms of the expected
underlying numbers of changes. That means that a branch of length 0.26
is 26 times as long as one which would show a 1% difference between
the protein (or nucleotide) sequences at the beginning and end of the
branch. But we would not expect the sequences at the beginning and end
of the branch to be 26% different, as there would be some overlaying
of changes.

<p>
One problem that can arise is that two or more of the species can be
so dissimilar that the distance between them would have to be
infinite, as the likelihood rises indefinitely as the estimated
divergence time increases. For example, with the Kimura model, if the
two sequences differ in 85.41% or more of their positions then the
estimate of divergence time would be infinite. Since there is no way
to represent an infinite distance in the output file, the program
regards this as an error, issues a warning message indicating which
pair of species are causing the problem, and computes a distance of
-1.0.
