<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Interactive construction of phylogenies from nucleic acid sequences,
with their evaluation by parsimony and compatibility and the display
of reconstructed ancestral bases. This can be used to find parsimony
or compatibility estimates by hand.

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


<p>
DNAMOVE is an interactive DNA parsimony program, inspired by Wayne
Maddison and David and Wayne Maddison's marvellous program MacClade,
which is written for Macintosh computers. DNAMOVE reads in a data set
which is prepared in almost the same format as one for the DNA
parsimony program DNAPARS. It allows the user to choose an initial
tree, and displays this tree on the screen. The user can look at
different sites and the way the nucleotide states are distributed on
that tree, given the most parsimonious reconstruction of state changes
for that particular tree. The user then can specify how the tree is to
be rearraranged, rerooted or written out to a file. By looking at
different rearrangements of the tree the user can manually search for
the most parsimonious tree, and can get a feel for how different sites
are affected by changes in the tree topology.

<p>
This program uses graphic characters that show the tree to best
advantage on some computer systems. Its graphic characters will work
best on MSDOS systems or MSDOS windows in Windows, and to any system
whose screen or terminals emulate ANSI standard terminals such as old
Digital VT100 terminals, Telnet programs, or VT100-compatible windows
in the X windowing system. For any other screen types, (such as
Macintosh windows) there is a generic option which does not make use
of screen graphics characters. The program will work well in those
cases, but the tree it displays will look a bit uglier.

<p>
This program carries out unrooted parsimony (analogous to Wagner
trees) (Eck and Dayhoff, 1966; Kluge and Farris, 1969) on DNA
sequences. The method of Fitch (1971) is used to count the number of
changes of base needed on a given tree.

<p>
The assumptions of this method
are exactly analogous to those of MIX:

<ol>

<li>
Each site evolves independently. 

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>
The probability of a base substitution at a given site is small over the lengths of time involved in a branch of the phylogeny. 

<li>
The expected amounts of change in different branches of the phylogeny do not vary by so much that two changes in a high-rate branch are more probable than one change in a low-rate branch. 

<li>
The expected amounts of change do not vary enough among sites that two changes in one site are more probable than one change in another. 

</ol>

<p>
That these are the assumptions of parsimony methods has been
documented in a series of papers of mine: (1973a, 1978b, 1979, 1981b,
1983b, 1988b). For an opposing view arguing that the parsimony methods
make no substantive assumptions such as these, see the papers by
Farris (1983) and Sober (1983a, 1983b), but also read the exchange
between Felsenstein and Sober (1986).

<p>
Change from an occupied site to a deletion is counted as one
change. Reversion from a deletion to an occupied site is allowed and
is also counted as one change.
