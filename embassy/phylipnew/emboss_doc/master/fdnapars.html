    Description
</H2>


Estimates phylogenies by the parsimony method using nucleic acid
sequences. Allows use the full IUB ambiguity codes, and estimates
ancestral nucleotide states. Gaps treated as a fifth nucleotide
state. It can also fo transversion parsimony. Can cope with
multifurcations, reconstruct ancestral states, use 0/1 character
weights, and infer branch lengths

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


This program carries out unrooted parsimony (analogous to Wagner
trees) (Eck and Dayhoff, 1966; Kluge and Farris, 1969) on DNA
sequences. The method of Fitch (1971) is used to count the number of
changes of base needed on a given tree. The assumptions of this method
are analogous to those of MIX:

<ol>

<li>
Each site evolves independently.

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently.

<li>
The probability of a base substitution at a given site
is small over the lengths of time involved in a branch of the
phylogeny.

<li>
The expected amounts of change in different branches of
the phylogeny do not vary by so much that two changes in a high-rate
branch are more probable than one change in a low-rate branch.

<li>
The expected amounts of change do not vary enough among sites that two
changes in one site are more probable than one change in another.

</ol>


<p>
That these are the assumptions of parsimony methods has been
documented in a series of papers of mine: (1973a, 1978b, 1979, 1981b,
1983b, 1988b). For an opposing view arguing that the parsimony methods
make no substantive assumptions such as these, see the papers by
Farris (1983) and Sober (1983a, 1983b, 1988), but also read the
exchange between Felsenstein and Sober (1986).

<p>
Change from an occupied site to a deletion is counted as one
change. Reversion from a deletion to an occupied site is allowed and
is also counted as one change. Note that this in effect assumes that a
deletion N bases long is N separate events.

<p>
Dnapars can handle both bifurcating and multifurcating trees. In doing
its search for most parsimonious trees, it adds species not only by
creating new forks in the middle of existing branches, but it also
tries putting them at the end of new branches which are added to
existing forks. Thus it searches among both bifurcating and
multifurcating trees. If a branch in a tree does not have any
characters which might change in that branch in the most parsimonious
tree, it does not save that tree. Thus in any tree that results, a
branch exists only if some character has a most parsimonious
reconstruction that would involve change in that branch.

It also saves a number of trees tied for best (you can alter the
<p>
number it saves using the V option in the menu). When rearranging
trees, it tries rearrangements of all of the saved trees. This makes
the algorithm slower than earlier versions of Dnapars.

<p>
The input data is standard. The first line of the input file contains
the number of species and the number of sites.

<p>
Next come the species data. Each sequence starts on a new line, has a
ten-character species name that must be blank-filled to be of that
length, followed immediately by the species data in the one-letter
code. The sequences must either be in the "interleaved" or
"sequential" formats described in the Molecular Sequence Programs
document. The I option selects between them. The sequences can have
internal blanks in the sequence but there must be no extra blanks at
the end of the terminated line. Note that a blank is not a valid
symbol for a deletion.

<b>fdnapars</b> output is standard: if option 1 is toggled on, the
data is printed out, with the convention that "." means "the same as
in the first species". Then comes a list of equally parsimonious
trees. Each tree has branch lengths. These are computed using an
algorithm published by Hochbaum and Pathria (1997) which I first heard
of from Wayne Maddison who invented it independently of them. This
algorithm averages the number of reconstructed changes of state over
all sites a over all possible most parsimonious placements of the
changes of state among branches. Note that it does not correct in any
way for multiple changes that overlay each other.

If option 2 is toggled on a table of the number of changes of state
required in each character is also printed. If option 5 is toggled on,
a table is printed out after each tree, showing for each branch
whether there are known to be changes in the branch, and what the
states are inferred to have been at the top end of the branch. This is
a reconstruction of the ancestral sequences in the tree. If you choose
option 5, a menu item "." appears which gives you the opportunity to
turn off dot-differencing so that complete ancestral sequences are
shown. If the inferred state is a "?" or one of the IUB ambiguity
symbols, there will be multiple equally-parsimonious assignments of
states; the user must work these out for themselves by hand. A "?" in
the reconstructed states means that in addition to one or more bases,
a deletion may or may not be present. If option 6 is left in its
default state the trees found will be written to a tree file, so that
they are available to be used in other programs.

If the U (User Tree) option is used and more than one tree is
supplied, the program also performs a statistical test of each of
these trees against the best tree. This test, which is a version of
the test proposed by Alan Templeton (1983) and evaluated in a test
case by me (1985a). It is closely parallel to a test using log
likelihood differences due to Kishino and Hasegawa (1989), and uses
the mean and variance of step differences between trees, taken across
sites. If the mean is more than 1.96 standard deviations different
then the trees are declared significantly different. The program
prints out a table of the steps for each tree, the differences of each
from the best one, the variance of that quantity as determined by the
step differences at individual sites, and a conclusion as to whether
that tree is or is not significantly worse than the best one. If the U
(User Tree) option is used and more than one tree is supplied, and the
program is not told to assume autocorrelation between the rates at
different sites, the program also performs a statistical test of each
of these trees against the one with highest likelihood. If there are
two user trees, this is a version of the test proposed by Alan
Templeton (1983) and evaluated in a test case by me (1985a). It is
closely parallel to a test using log likelihood differences due to
Kishino and Hasegawa (1989) It uses the mean and variance of the
differences in the number of steps between trees, taken across
sites. If the two trees' means are more than 1.96 standard deviations
different, then the trees are declared significantly different.

If there are more than two trees, the test done is an extension of the
KHT test, due to Shimodaira and Hasegawa (1999). They pointed out that
a correction for the number of trees was necessary, and they
introduced a resampling method to make this correction. In the version
used here the variances and covariances of the sums of steps across
sites are computed for all pairs of trees. To test whether the
difference between each tree and the best one is larger than could
have been expected if they all had the same expected number of steps,
numbers of steps for all trees are sampled with these covariances and
equal means (Shimodaira and Hasegawa's "least favorable hypothesis"),
and a P value is computed from the fraction of times the difference
between the tree's value and the lowest number of steps exceeds that
actually observed. Note that this sampling needs random numbers, and
so the program will prompt the user for a random number seed if one
has not already been supplied. With the two-tree KHT test no random
numbers are used.

In either the KHT or the SH test the program prints out a table of the
number of steps for each tree, the differences of each from the lowest
one, the variance of that quantity as determined by the differences of
the numbers of steps at individual sites, and a conclusion as to
whether that tree is or is not significantly worse than the best one.

Option 6 in the menu controls whether the tree estimated by the
program is written onto a tree file. The default name of this output
tree file is "outtree". If the U option is in effect, all the
user-defined trees are written to the output tree file. If the program
finds multiple trees tied for best, all of these are written out onto
the output tree file. Each is followed by a numerical weight in square
brackets (such as [0.25000]). This is needed when we use the trees to
make a consensus tree of the results of bootstrapping or jackknifing,
to avoid overrepresenting replicates that find many tied trees.
