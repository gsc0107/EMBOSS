<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Same as PROML but assumes a molecular clock. The use of the two
programs together permits a likelihood ratio test of the molecular
clock hypothesis to be made.
<p>
Estimates phylogenies from protein amino acid sequences by maximum
likelihood. The PAM, JTT, or PMB models can be employed, and also use
of a Hidden Markov model of rates, with the program inferring which
sites have which rates. This also allows gamma-distribution and
gamma-plus-invariant sites distributions of rates across sites. It
also allows different rates of change at known sites.


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


This program implements the maximum likelihood method for protein
amino acid sequences under the constraint that the trees estimated
must be consistent with a molecular clock. The molecular clock is the
assumption that the tips of the tree are all equidistant, in branch
length, from its root. This program is indirectly related to PROML. It
uses the Dayhoff probability model of change between amino acids. Its
algorithmic details are not yet published, but many of them are
similar to DNAMLK.

<p>
The assumptions of the model are: 

<ol>

<li>
Each position in the sequence evolves independently. 

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>
Each position undergoes substitution at an expected rate which is
chosen from a series of rates (each with a probability of occurrence)
which we specify.

<li>
All relevant positions are included in the sequence, not just those
that have changed or those that are "phylogenetically informative".

<li>
The probabilities of change between amino acids are given by the model
of Jones,

<li>
 Taylor, and Thornton (1992), the PMB model of Veerassamy, Smith and
 Tillier (2004), or the PAM model of Dayhoff (Dayhoff and Eck, 1968;
 Dayhoff et. al., 1979).

</ol>

<p>
Note the assumption that we are looking at all positions, including
those that have not changed at all. It is important not to restrict
attention to some positions based on whether or not they have changed;
doing that would bias branch lengths by making them too long, and that
in turn would cause the method to misinterpret the meaning of those
positions that had changed.

<p>
This program uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method of inferring
different rates of evolution at different amino acid positions. This
was described in a paper by me and Gary Churchill (1996). It allows us
to specify to the program that there will be a number of different
possible evolutionary rates, what the prior probabilities of
occurrence of each is, and what the average length of a patch of
positions all having the same rate. The rates can also be chosen by
the program to approximate a Gamma distribution of rates, or a Gamma
distribution plus a class of invariant positions. The program computes
the likelihood by summing it over all possible assignments of rates to
positions, weighting each by its prior probability of occurrence.

<p>
For example, if we have used the C and A options (described below) to
specify that there are three possible rates of evolution, 1.0, 2.4,
and 0.0, that the prior probabilities of a position having these rates
are 0.4, 0.3, and 0.3, and that the average patch length (number of
consecutive positions with the same rate) is 2.0, the program will sum
the likelihood over all possibilities, but giving less weight to those
that (say) assign all positions to rate 2.4, or that fail to have
consecutive positions that have the same rate.

<p>
The Hidden Markov Model framework for rate variation among positions
was independently developed by Yang (1993, 1994, 1995). We have
implemented a general scheme for a Hidden Markov Model of rates; we
allow the rates and their prior probabilities to be specified
arbitrarily by the user, or by a discrete approximation to a Gamma
distribution of rates (Yang, 1995), or by a mixture of a Gamma
distribution and a class of invariant positions.

<p>
This feature effectively removes the artificial assumption that all
positions have the same rate, and also means that we need not know in
advance the identities of the positions that have a particular rate of
evolution.

<p>
Another layer of rate variation also is available. The user can assign
categories of rates to each positions (for example, we might want
amino acid positions in the active site of a protein to change more
slowly than other positions. This is done with the categories input
file and the C option. We then specify (using the menu) the relative
rates of evolution of amino acid positions in the different
categories. For example, we might specify that positions in the active
site evolve at relative rates of 0.2 compared to 1.0 at other
positions. If we are assuming that a particular position maintains a
cysteine bridge to another, we may want to put it in a category of
positions (including perhaps the initial position of the protein
sequence which maintains methionine) which changes at a rate of 0.0.

<p>
If both user-assigned rate categories and Hidden Markov Model rates
are allowed, the program assumes that the actual rate at a position is
the product of the user-assigned category rate and the Hidden Markov
Model regional rate. (This may not always make perfect biological
sense: it would be more natural to assume some upper bound to the
rate, as we have discussed in the Felsenstein and Churchill
paper). Nevertheless you may want to use both types of rate variation.

<b>fpromlk</b> output starts by giving the number of species, the
number of amino acid positions.

<p>
If the R (HMM rates) option is used a table of the relative rates of
expected substitution at each category of positions is printed, as
well as the probabilities of each of those rates.

<p>
There then follow the data sequences, if the user has selected the
menu option to print them out, with the base sequences printed in
groups of ten amino acids. The trees found are printed as a rooted
tree topology. The internal nodes are numbered arbitrarily for the
sake of identification. The number of trees evaluated so far and the
log likelihood of the tree are also given. The branch lengths in the
diagram are roughly proportional to the estimated branch lengths,
except that very short branches are printed out at least three
characters in length so that the connections can be seen. The unit of
branch length is the expected fraction of amino acids changed (so that
1.0 is 100 PAMs).

<p>
A table is printed showing the length of each tree segment, and the
time (in units of expected amino acid substitutions per position) of
each fork in the tree, measured from the root of the tree. I have not
attempted in include code for approximate confidence limits on branch
points, as I have done for branch lengths in PROML, both because of
the extreme crudeness of that test, and because the variation of times
for different forks would be highly correlated.

<p>
The log likelihood printed out with the final tree can be used to
perform various likelihood ratio tests. One can, for example, compare
runs with different values of the relative rate of change in the
active site and in the rest of the protein to determine which value is
the maximum likelihood estimate, and what is the allowable range of
values (using a likelihood ratio test, which you will find described
in mathematical statistics books). One could also estimate the base
frequencies in the same way. Both of these, particularly the latter,
require multiple runs of the program to evaluate different possibl
values, and this might get expensive.

<p>
This program makes possible a (reasonably) legitimate statistical test
of the molecular clock. To do such a test, run PROML and PROMLK on the
same data. If the trees obtained are of the same topology (when
considered as unrooted), it is legitimate to compare their likelihoods
by the likelihood ratio test. In PROML the likelihood has been
computed by estimating 2n-3 branch lengths, if their are n tips on the
tree. In PROMLK it has been computed by estimating n-1 branching times
(in effect, n-1 branch lengths). The difference in the number of
parameters is (2n-3)-(n-1) = n-2. To perform the test take the
difference in log likelihoods between the two runs (PROML should be
the higher of the two, barring numerical iteration difficulties) and
double it. Look this up on a chi-square distribution with n-2 degrees
of freedom. If the result is significant, the log likelihood has been
significantly increased by allowing all 2n-3 branch lengths to be
estimated instead of just n-1, and molecular clock may be rejected.

<p>
If the U (User Tree) option is used and more than one tree is
supplied, and the program is not told to assume autocorrelation
between the rates at different amino acid positions, the program also
performs a statistical test of each of these trees against the one
with highest likelihood. If there are two user trees, the test done is
one which is due to Kishino and Hasegawa (1989), a version of a test
originally introduced by Templeton (1983). In this implementation it
uses the mean and variance of log-likelihood differences between
trees, taken across amino acid positions. If the two trees' means are
more than 1.96 standard deviations different then the trees are
declared significantly different. This use of the empirical variance
of log-likelihood differences is more robust and nonparametric than
the classical likelihood ratio test, and may to some extent compensate
for the any lack of realism in the model underlying this program.

<p>
If there are more than two trees, the test done is an extension of the
KHT test, due to Shimodaira and Hasegawa (1999). They pointed out that
a correction for the number of trees was necessary, and they
introduced a resampling method to make this correction. In the version
used here the variances and covariances of the sum of log likelihoods
across amino acid positions are computed for all pairs of trees. To
test whether the difference between each tree and the best one is
larger than could have been expected if they all had the same expected
log-likelihood, log-likelihoods for all trees are sampled with these
covariances and equal means (Shimodaira and Hasegawa's "least
favorable hypothesis"), and a P value is computed from the fraction of
times the difference between the tree's value and the highest
log-likelihood exceeds that actually observed. Note that this sampling
needs random numbers, and so the program will prompt the user for a
random number seed if one has not already been supplied. With the
two-tree KHT test no random numbers are used.

<p>
In either the KHT or the SH test the program prints out a table of the
log-likelihoods of each tree, the differences of each from the highest
one, the variance of that quantity as determined by the log-likelihood
differences at individual sites, and a conclusion as to whether that
tree is or is not significantly worse than the best one. However the
test is not available if we assume that there is autocorrelation of
rates at neighboring positions (option A) and is not done in those
cases.

<p>
The branch lengths printed out are scaled in terms of 100 times the
expected numbers of amino acid substitutions, scaled so that the
average rate of change, averaged over all the positions analyzed, is
set to 100.0, if there are multiple categories of positions. This
means that whether or not there are multiple categories of positions,
the expected percentage of change for very small branches is equal to
the branch length. Of course, when a branch is twice as long this does
not mean that there will be twice as much net change expected along
it, since some of the changes occur in the same position and overlie
or even reverse each other. underlying numbers of changes. That means
that a branch of length 26 is 26 times as long as one which would show
a 1% difference between the amino acid sequences at the beginning and
end of the branch, but we would not expect the sequences at the
beginning and end of the branch to be 26% different, as there would be
some overlaying of changes.

<p>
Because of limitations of the numerical algorithm, branch length
estimates of zero will often print out as small numbers such as
0.00001. If you see a branch length that small, it is really estimated
to be of zero length.

<p>
Another possible source of confusion is the existence of negative
values for the log likelihood. This is not really a problem; the log
likelihood is not a probability but the logarithm of a
probability. When it is negative it simply means that the
corresponding probability is less than one (since we are seeing its
logarithm). The log likelihood is maximized by being made more
positive: -30.23 is worse than -29.14.

<p>
At the end of the output, if the R option is in effect with multiple
HMM rates, the program will print a list of what amino acid position
categories contributed the most to the final likelihood. This
combination of HMM rate categories need not have contributed a
majority of the likelihood, just a plurality. Still, it will be
helpful as a view of where the program infers that the higher and
lower rates are. Note that the use in this calculations of the prior
probabilities of different rates, and the average patch length, gives
this inference a "smoothed" appearance: some other combination of
rates might make a greater contribution to the likelihood, but be
discounted because it conflicts with this prior information. See the
example output below to see what this printout of rate categories
looks like. A second list will also be printed out, showing for each
position which rate accounted for the highest fraction of the
likelihood. If the fraction of the likelihood accounted for is less
than 95%, a dot is printed instead.

<p>
Option 3 in the menu controls whether the tree is printed out into the
output file. This is on by default, and usually you will want to leave
it this way. However for runs with multiple data sets such as
bootstrapping runs, you will primarily be interested in the trees
which are written onto the output tree file, rather than the trees
printed on the output file. To keep the output file from becoming too
large, it may be wisest to use option 3 to prevent trees being printed
onto the output file.

<p>
Option 4 in the menu controls whether the tree estimated by the
program is written onto a tree file. The default name of this output
tree file is "outtree". If the U option is in effect, all the
user-defined trees are written to the output tree file.

<p>
Option 5 in the menu controls whether ancestral states are estimated
at each node in the tree. If it is in effect, a table of ancestral
sequences is printed out (including the sequences in the tip species
which are the input sequences). The symbol printed out is for the
amino acid which accounts for the largest fraction of the likelihood
at that position. In that table, if a position has an amino acid which
accounts for more than 95% of the likelihood, its symbol printed in
capital letters (W rather than w). One limitation of the current
version of the program is that when there are multiple HMM rates
(option R) the reconstructed amino acids are based on only the single
assignment of rates to positions which accounts for the largest amount
of the likelihood. Thus the assessment of 95% of the likelihood, in
tabulating the ancestral states, refers to 95% of the likelihood that
is accounted for by that particular combination of rates.
