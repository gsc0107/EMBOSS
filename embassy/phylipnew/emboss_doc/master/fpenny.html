    Description
</H2>

Finds all most parsimonious phylogenies for discrete-character data
with two states, for the Wagner, Camin-Sokal, and mixed parsimony
criteria using the branch-and-bound method of exact search. May be
impractical (depending on the data) for more than 10-11 species.




<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


PENNY is a program that will find all of the most parsimonious trees
implied by your data. It does so not by examining all possible trees,
but by using the more sophisticated "branch and bound" algorithm, a
standard computer science search strategy first applied to
phylogenetic inference by Hendy and Penny (1982). (J. S. Farris
[personal communication, 1975] had also suggested that this strategy,
which is well-known in computer science, might be applied to
phylogenies, but he did not publish this suggestion).

<p>
There is, however, a price to be paid for the certainty that one has
found all members of the set of most parsimonious trees. The problem
of finding these has been shown (Graham and Foulds, 1982; Day, 1983)
to be NP-complete, which is equivalent to saying that there is no fast
algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the problem in all cases (for a
discussion of NP-completeness, see the Scientific American article by
Lewis and Papadimitriou, 1978). The result is that this program,
despite its algorithmic sophistication, is VERY SLOW.

<p>
The program should be slower than the other tree-building programs in
the package, but useable up to about ten species. Above this it will
bog down rapidly, but exactly when depends on the data and on how much
computer time you have (it may be more effective in the hands of
someone who can let a microcomputer grind all night than for someone
who has the "benefit" of paying for time on the campus mainframe
computer). IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO GET A FEEL FOR HOW LONG THE
PROGRAM WILL TAKE ON YOUR DATA. This can be done by running it on
subsets of the species, increasing the number of species in the run
until you either are able to treat the full data set or know that the
program will take unacceptably long on it. (Making a plot of the
logarithm of run time against species number may help to project run
times).


<h3>The Algorithm</h3>

<p>
The search strategy used by PENNY starts by making a tree consisting
of the first two species (the first three if the tree is to be
unrooted). Then it tries to add the next species in all possible
places (there are three of these). For each of the resulting trees it
evaluates the number of steps. It adds the next species to each of
these, again in all possible spaces. If this process would continue it
would simply generate all possible trees, of which there are a very
large number even when the number of species is moderate (34,459,425
with 10 species). Actually it does not do this, because the trees are
generated in a particular order and some of them are never generated.

<p>
Actually the order in which trees are generated is not quite as
implied above, but is a "depth-first search". This means that first
one adds the third species in the first possible place, then the
fourth species in its first possible place, then the fifth and so on
until the first possible tree has been produced. Its number of steps
is evaluated. Then one "backtracks" by trying the alternative
placements of the last species. When these are exhausted one tries the
next placement of the next-to-last species. The order of placement in
a depth-first search is like this for a four-species case (parentheses
enclose monophyletic groups): 

<p>
<pre>
     Make tree of first two species     (A,B)
          Add C in first place     ((A,B),C)
               Add D in first place     (((A,D),B),C)
               Add D in second place     ((A,(B,D)),C)
               Add D in third place     (((A,B),D),C)
               Add D in fourth place     ((A,B),(C,D))
               Add D in fifth place     (((A,B),C),D)
          Add C in second place: ((A,C),B)
               Add D in first place     (((A,D),C),B)
               Add D in second place     ((A,(C,D)),B)
               Add D in third place     (((A,C),D),B)
               Add D in fourth place     ((A,C),(B,D))
               Add D in fifth place     (((A,C),B),D)
          Add C in third place     (A,(B,C))
               Add D in first place     ((A,D),(B,C))
               Add D in second place     (A,((B,D),C))
               Add D in third place     (A,(B,(C,D)))
               Add D in fourth place     (A,((B,C),D))
               Add D in fifth place     ((A,(B,C)),D)
</pre>

<p>
Among these fifteen trees you will find all of the four-species rooted
bifurcating trees, each exactly once (the parentheses each enclose a
monophyletic group). As displayed above, the backtracking depth-first
search algorithm is just another way of producing all possible trees
one at a time. The branch and bound algorithm consists of this with
one change. As each tree is constructed, including the partial trees
such as (A,(B,C)), its number of steps is evaluated. In addition a
prediction is made as to how many steps will be added, at a minimum,
as further species are added.

<p>
This is done by counting how many binary characters which are
invariant in the data up the species most recently added will
ultimately show variation when further species are added. Thus if 20
characters vary among species A, B, and C and their root, and if tree
((A,C),B) requires 24 steps, then if there are 8 more characters which
will be seen to vary when species D is added, we can immediately say
that no matter how we add D, the resulting tree can have no less than
24 + 8 = 32 steps. The point of all this is that if a previously-found
tree such as ((A,B),(C,D)) required only 30 steps, then we know that
there is no point in even trying to add D to ((A,C),B). We have
computed the bound that enables us to cut off a whole line of inquiry
(in this case five trees) and avoid going down that particular branch
any farther.

<p>
The branch-and-bound algorithm thus allows us to find all most
parsimonious trees without generating all possible trees. How much of
a saving this is depends strongly on the data. For very clean (nearly
"Hennigian") data, it saves much time, but on very messy data it will
still take a very long time.

<p>
The algorithm in the program differs from the one outlined here in
some essential details: it investigates possibilities in the order of
their apparent promise. This applies to the order of addition of
species, and to the places where they are added to the tree. After the
first two-species tree is constructed, the program tries adding each
of the remaining species in turn, each in the best possible place it
can find. Whichever of those species adds (at a minimum) the most
additional steps is taken to be the one to be added next to the
tree. When it is added, it is added in turn to places which cause the
fewest additional steps to be added. This sounds a bit complex, but it
is done with the intention of eliminating regions of the search of all
possible trees as soon as possible, and lowering the bound on tree
length as quickly as possible.

<p>
The program keeps a list of all the most parsimonious trees found so
far. Whenever it finds one that has fewer steps than these, it clears
out the list and restarts the list with that tree. In the process the
bound tightens and fewer possibilities need be investigated. At the
end the list contains all the shortest trees. These are then printed
out. It should be mentioned that the program CLIQUE for finding all
largest cliques also works by branch-and-bound. Both problems are
NP-complete but for some reason CLIQUE runs far faster. Although their
worst-case behavior is bad for both programs, those worst cases occur
far more frequently in parsimony problems than in compatibility
problems.


<h3>Controlling Run Times</h3>

<p>
Among the quantities available to be set at the beginning of a run of
PENNY, two (howoften and howmany) are of particular importance. As
PENNY goes along it will keep count of how many trees it has
examined. Suppose that howoften is 100 and howmany is 1000, the
default settings. Every time 100 trees have been examined, PENNY will
print out a line saying how many multiples of 100 trees have now been
examined, how many steps the most parsimonious tree found so far has,
how many trees of with that number of steps have been found, and a
very rough estimate of what fraction of all trees have been looked at
so far.

<p>
When the number of these multiples printed out reaches the number
howmany (say 1000), the whole algorithm aborts and prints out that it
has not found all most parsimonious trees, but prints out what is has
got so far anyway. These trees need not be any of the most
parsimonious trees: they are simply the most parsimonious ones found
so far. By setting the product (howoften times howmany) large you can
make the algorithm less likely to abort, but then you risk getting
bogged down in a gigantic computation. You should adjust these
constants so that the program cannot go beyond examining the number of
trees you are reasonably willing to wait for. In their initial setting
the program will abort after looking at 100,000 trees. Obviously you
may want to adjust howoften in order to get more or fewer lines of
intermediate notice of how many trees have been looked at so far. Of
course, in small cases you may never even reach the first multiple of
howoften and nothing will be printed out except some headings and then
the final trees.

<p>
The indication of the approximate percentage of trees searched so far
will be helpful in judging how much farther you would have to go to
get the full search. Actually, since that fraction is the fraction of
the set of all possible trees searched or ruled out so far, and since
the search becomes progressively more efficient, the approximate
fraction printed out will usually be an underestimate of how far along
the program is, sometimes a serious underestimate.

<p>
A constant that affects the result is "maxtrees", which controls the
maximum number of trees that can be stored. Thus if "maxtrees" is 25,
and 32 most parsimonious trees are found, only the first 25 of these
are stored and printed out. If "maxtrees" is increased, the program
does not run any slower but requires a little more intermediate
storage space. I recommend that "maxtrees" be kept as large as you
can, provided you are willing to look at an output with that many
trees on it! Initially, "maxtrees" is set to 100 in the distribution
copy.


<h3>Methods and Options</h3>

<p>
The counting of the length of trees is done by an algorithm nearly
identical to the corresponding algorithms in MIX, and thus the
remainder of this document will be nearly identical to the MIX
document. MIX is a general parsimony program which carries out the
Wagner and Camin-Sokal parsimony methods in mixture, where each
character can have its method specified. The program defaults to
carrying out Wagner parsimony.

<p>
The Camin-Sokal parsimony method explains the data by assuming that
changes 0 --&gt; 1 are allowed but not changes 1 --&gt; 0. Wagner parsimony
allows both kinds of changes. (This under the assumption that 0 is the
ancestral state, though the program allows reassignment of the
ancestral state, in which case we must reverse the state numbers 0 and
1 throughout this discussion). The criterion is to find the tree which
requires the minimum number of changes. The Camin-Sokal method is due
to Camin and Sokal (1965) and the Wagner method to Eck and Dayhoff
(1966) and to Kluge and Farris (1969).

<p>
Here are the assumptions of these two methods: 

<ol>

<li>
Ancestral states are known (Camin-Sokal) or unknown (Wagner). 

<li>
Different characters evolve independently. 

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>
Changes 0 --&gt; 1 are much more probable than changes 1 --&gt; 0
(Camin-Sokal) or equally probable (Wagner).

<li>
Both of these kinds of changes are a priori improbable over the
evolutionary time spans involved in the differentiation of the group
in question.

<li>
Other kinds of evolutionary event such as retention of polymorphism
are far less probable than 0 --&gt; 1 changes.

<li>
Rates of evolution in different lineages are sufficiently low that two
changes in a long segment of the tree are far less probable than one
change in a short segment.

</ol>

<p>
That these are the assumptions of parsimony methods has been
documented in a series of papers of mine: (1973a, 1978b, 1979, 1981b,
1983b, 1988b). For an opposing view arguing that the parsimony methods
make no substantive assumptions such as these, see the papers by
Farris (1983) and Sober (1983a, 1983b), but also read the exchange
between Felsenstein and Sober (1986).

<b>fpenny</b> output is standard: a set of trees, which will be
printed as rooted or unrooted depending on which is appropriate, and
if the user elects to see them, tables of the number of changes of
state required in each character. If the Wagner option is in force for
a character, it may not be possible to unambiguously locate the places
on the tree where the changes occur, as there may be multiple
possibilities. A table is available to be printed out after each tree,
showing for each branch whether there are known to be changes in the
branch, and what the states are inferred to have been at the top end
of the branch. If the inferred state is a "?" there will be multiple
equally-parsimonious assignments of states; the user must work these
out for themselves by hand.

<p>
If the Camin-Sokal parsimony method (option C or S) is invoked and the
A option is also used, then the program will infer, for any character
whose ancestral state is unknown ("?") whether the ancestral state 0
or 1 will give the fewest state changes. If these are tied, then it
may not be possible for the program to infer the state in the internal
nodes, and these will all be printed as ".". If this has happened and
you want to know more about the states at the internal nodes, you will
find helpful to use MOVE to display the tree and examine its interior
states, as the algorithm in MOVE shows all that can be known in this
case about the interior states, including where there is and is not
amibiguity. The algorithm in PENNY gives up more easily on displaying
these states.

<p>
If the A option is not used, then the program will assume 0 as the
ancestral state for those characters following the Camin-Sokal method,
and will assume that the ancestral state is unknown for those
characters following Wagner parsimony. If any characters have unknown
ancestral states, and if the resulting tree is rooted (even by
outgroup), a table will be printed out showing the best guesses of
which are the ancestral states in each character. You will find it
useful to understand the difference between the Camin-Sokal parsimony
criterion with unknown ancestral state and the Wagner parsimony
criterion.

<p>
If option 6 is left in its default state the trees found will be
written to a tree file, so that they are available to be used in other
programs. If the program finds multiple trees tied for best, all of
these are written out onto the output tree file. Each is followed by a
numerical weight in square brackets (such as [0.25000]). This is
needed when we use the trees to make a consensus tree of the results
of bootstrapping or jackknifing, to avoid overrepresenting replicates
that find many tied trees.
