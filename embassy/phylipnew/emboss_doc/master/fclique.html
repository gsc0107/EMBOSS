<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Finds the largest clique of mutually compatible characters, and the
phylogeny which they recommend, for discrete character data with two
states. The largest clique (or all cliques within a given size range
of the largest one) are found by a very fast branch and bound search
method. The method does not allow for missing data. For such cases the
T (Threshold) option of PARS or MIX may be a useful
alternative. Compatibility methods are particular useful when some
characters are of poor quality and the rest of good quality, but when
it is not known in advance which ones are which.



<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

This program uses the compatibility method for unrooted two-state
characters to obtain the largest cliques of characters and the trees
which they suggest. This approach originated in the work of Le Quesne
(1969), though the algorithms were not precisely specified until the
later work of Estabrook, Johnson, and McMorris (1976a, 1976b). These
authors proved the theorem that a group of two-state characters which
were pairwise compatible would be jointly compatible. This program
uses an algorithm inspired by the Kent Fiala - George Estabrook
program CLINCH, though closer in detail to the algorithm of Bron and
Kerbosch (1973). I am indebted to Kent Fiala for pointing out that
paper to me, and to David Penny for decribing to me his
branch-and-bound approach to finding largest cliques, from which I
have also borrowed. I am particularly grateful to Kent Fiala for
catching a bug in versions 2.0 and 2.1 which resulted in those
versions failing to find all of the cliques which they should. The
program computes a compatibility matrix for the characters, then uses
a recursive procedure to examine all possible cliques of characters.

<p>
After one pass through all possible cliques, the program knows the
size of the largest clique, and during a second pass it prints out the
cliques of the right size. It also, along with each clique, prints out
the tree suggested by that clique.

<h3>
  ASSUMPTIONS
</h3>
Basically the following assumptions are made: 

<ol>

<li>Each character evolves independently. 

<li>Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>The ancestral state is not known. 

<li>Each character has a small chance of being one which evolves so
rapidly, or is so thoroughly misinterpreted, that it provides no
information on the tree.

<li>The probability of a single change in a character (other than in
the high rate characters) is low but not as low as the probability of
being one of these "bad" characters.

<li>The probability of two changes in a low-rate character is much
less than the probability that it is a high-rate character.

<li>The true tree has segments which are not so unequal in length that
two changes in a long are as easy to envisage as one change in a short
segment.  </ol>

<p>
The assumptions of compatibility methods have been treated in several
of my papers (1978b, 1979, 1981b, 1988b), especially the 1981
paper. For an opposing view arguing that the parsimony methods make no
substantive assumptions such as these, see the papers by Farris (1983)
and Sober (1983a, 1983b), but also read the exchange between
Felsenstein and Sober (1986).

<p>
A constant available for alteration at the beginning of the program is
the form width, "FormWide", which you may want to change to make it as
large as possible consistent with the page width available on your
output device, so as to avoid the output of cliques and of trees
getting wrapped around unnecessarily.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

Input to the algorithm is standard, but the "?", "P", and "B" states
are not allowed. This is a serious limitation of this program. If you
want to find large cliques in data that have "?" states, I recommend
that you use <b>fmix</b> instead with the -Threshold option and the value
of the threshold set to 2.0. The theory underlying this is given in my
paper on character weighting (Felsenstein, 1981b).


<p>

<b>fclique</b> reads discrete character data with 2 states.
