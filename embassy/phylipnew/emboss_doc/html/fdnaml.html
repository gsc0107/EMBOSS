<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Estimates phylogenies from nucleotide sequences by maximum
likelihood. The model employed allows for unequal expected frequencies
of the four nucleotides, for unequal rates of transitions and
transversions, and for different (prespecified) rates of change in
different categories of sites, and also use of a Hidden Markov model
of rates, with the program inferring which sites have which
rates. This also allows gamma-distribution and gamma-plus-invariant
sites distributions of rates across sites.

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


This program implements the maximum likelihood method for DNA
sequences. The present version is faster than earlier versions of
DNAML. Details of the algorithm are published in the paper by
Felsenstein and Churchill (1996). The model of base substitution
allows the expected frequencies of the four bases to be unequal,
allows the expected frequencies of transitions and transversions to be
unequal, and has several ways of allowing different rates of evolution
at different sites.

<p>
The assumptions of the present model are: 

<ol>

<li>
Each site in the sequence evolves independently. 

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>
Each site undergoes substitution at an expected rate which is chosen
from a series of rates (each with a probability of occurrence) which
we specify.

<li>
All relevant sites are included in the sequence, not just those that
have changed or those that are "phylogenetically informative".

<li>
A substitution consists of one of two sorts of events:

<ol>

<li> The first kind of event consists of the replacement of the
existing base by a base drawn from a pool of purines or a pool of
pyrimidines (depending on whether the base being replaced was a purine
or a pyrimidine). It can lead either to no change or to a transition.

<li> The second kind of event consists of the replacement of the
existing base by a base drawn at random from a pool of bases at known
frequencies, independently of the identity of the base which is being
replaced. This could lead either to a no change, to a transition or to
a transversion.

<p>
The ratio of the two purines in the purine replacement pool is the
same as their ratio in the overall pool, and similarly for the
pyrimidines.

<p>
The ratios of transitions to transversions can be set by the user. The
substitution process can be diagrammed as follows: Suppose that you
specified A, C, G, and T base frequencies of 0.24, 0.28, 0.27, and
0.21.


<ul>

<li>
First kind of event: 

<p>
Determine whether the existing base is a purine or a pyrimidine. 
Draw from the proper pool: 

<p>
<pre>

      Purine pool:                Pyrimidine pool:

     |               |            |               |
     |   0.4706 A    |            |   0.5714 C    |
     |   0.5294 G    |            |   0.4286 T    |
     | (ratio is     |            | (ratio is     |
     |  0.24 : 0.27) |            |  0.28 : 0.21) |
     |_______________|            |_______________|

</pre>

<li>
Second kind of event:

<p>

Draw from the overall pool: 

<p>
<pre>

              |                  |
              |      0.24 A      |
              |      0.28 C      |
              |      0.27 G      |
              |      0.21 T      |
              |__________________|

</pre>

</ul>

</ol>

</ol>

<p>
Note that if the existing base is, say, an A, the first kind of event
has a 0.4706 probability of "replacing" it by another A. The second
kind of event has a 0.24 chance of replacing it by another A. This
rather disconcerting model is used because it has nice mathematical
properties that make likelihood calculations far easier. A closely
similar, but not precisely identical model having different rates of
transitions and transversions has been used by Hasegawa
et. al. (1985b). The transition probability formulas for the current
model were given (with my permission) by Kishino and Hasegawa
(1989). Another explanation is available in the paper by Felsenstein
and Churchill (1996).

<p>
Note the assumption that we are looking at all sites, including those
that have not changed at all. It is important not to restrict
attention to some sites based on whether or not they have changed;
doing that would bias branch lengths by making them too long, and that
in turn would cause the method to misinterpret the meaning of those
sites that had changed.

<p>
This program uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method of inferring
different rates of evolution at different sites. This was described in
a paper by me and Gary Churchill (1996). It allows us to specify to
the program that there will be a number of different possible
evolutionary rates, what the prior probabilities of occurrence of each
is, and what the average length of a patch of sites all having the
same rate. The rates can also be chosen by the program to approximate
a Gamma distribution of rates, or a Gamma distribution plus a class of
invariant sites. The program computes the the likelihood by summing it
over all possible assignments of rates to sites, weighting each by its
prior probability of occurrence.

<p>
For example, if we have used the C and A options (described below) to
specify that there are three possible rates of evolution, 1.0, 2.4,
and 0.0, that the prior probabilities of a site having these rates are
0.4, 0.3, and 0.3, and that the average patch length (number of
consecutive sites with the same rate) is 2.0, the program will sum the
likelihood over all possibilities, but giving less weight to those
that (say) assign all sites to rate 2.4, or that fail to have
consecutive sites that have the same rate.

<p>
The Hidden Markov Model framework for rate variation among sites was
independently developed by Yang (1993, 1994, 1995). We have
implemented a general scheme for a Hidden Markov Model of rates; we
allow the rates and their prior probabilities to be specified
arbitrarily by the user, or by a discrete approximation to a Gamma
distribution of rates (Yang, 1995), or by a mixture of a Gamma
distribution and a class of invariant sites.

<p>
This feature effectively removes the artificial assumption that all
sites have the same rate, and also means that we need not know in
advance the identities of the sites that have a particular rate of
evolution.

<p>
Another layer of rate variation also is available. The user can assign
categories of rates to each site (for example, we might want first,
second, and third codon positions in a protein coding sequence to be
three different categories. This is done with the categories input
file and the C option. We then specify (using the menu) the relative
rates of evolution of sites in the different categories. For example,
we might specify that first, second, and third positions evolve at
relative rates of 1.0, 0.8, and 2.7.

<p>
If both user-assigned rate categories and Hidden Markov Model rates
are allowed, the program assumes that the actual rate at a site is the
product of the user-assigned category rate and the Hidden Markov Model
regional rate. (This may not always make perfect biological sense: it
would be more natural to assume some upper bound to the rate, as we
have discussed in the Felsenstein and Churchill paper). Nevertheless
you may want to use both types of rate variation.

    Output file format
</H2>


<b>fdnaml</b> output starts by giving the number of species, the
number of sites, and the base frequencies for A, C, G, and T that have
been specified. It then prints out the transition/transversion ratio
that was specified or used by default. It also uses the base
frequencies to compute the actual transition/transversion ratio
implied by the parameter.

<p>
If the R (HMM rates) option is used a table of the relative rates of
expected substitution at each category of sites is printed, as well as
the probabilities of each of those rates.

<p>
There then follow the data sequences, if the user has selected the
menu option to print them out, with the base sequences printed in
groups of ten bases along the lines of the Genbank and EMBL
formats. The trees found are printed as an unrooted tree topology
(possibly rooted by outgroup if so requested). The internal nodes are
numbered arbitrarily for the sake of identification. The number of
trees evaluated so far and the log likelihood of the tree are also
given. Note that the trees printed out have a trifurcation at the
base. The branch lengths in the diagram are roughly proportional to
the estimated branch lengths, except that very short branches are
printed out at least three characters in length so that the
connections can be seen.

<p>
A table is printed showing the length of each tree segment (in units
of expected nucleotide substitutions per site), as well as (very)
rough confidence limits on their lengths. If a confidence limit is
negative, this indicates that rearrangement of the tree in that region
is not excluded, while if both limits are positive, rearrangement is
still not necessarily excluded because the variance calculation on
which the confidence limits are based results in an underestimate,
which makes the confidence limits too narrow.

<p>
In addition to the confidence limits, the program performs a crude
Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) for each branch of the tree. The program
computes the ratio of likelihoods with and without this branch length
forced to zero length. This done by comparing the likelihoods changing
only that branch length. A truly correct LRT would force that branch
length to zero and also allow the other branch lengths to adjust to
that. The result would be a likelihood ratio closer to 1. Therefore
the present LRT will err on the side of being too significant. YOU ARE
WARNED AGAINST TAKING IT TOO SERIOUSLY. If you want to get a better
likelihood curve for a branch length you can do multiple runs with
different prespecified lengths for that branch, as discussed above in
the discussion of the L option.

<p>
One should also realize that if you are looking not at a
previously-chosen branch but at all branches, that you are seeing the
results of multiple tests. With 20 tests, one is expected to reach
significance at the P = .05 level purely by chance. You should
therefore use a much more conservative significance level, such as .05
divided by the number of tests. The significance of these tests is
shown by printing asterisks next to the confidence interval on each
branch length. It is important to keep in mind that both the
confidence limits and the tests are very rough and approximate, and
probably indicate more significance than they should. Nevertheless,
maximum likelihood is one of the few methods that can give you any
indication of its own error; most other methods simply fail to warn
the user that there is any error! (In fact, whole philosophical
schools of taxonomists exist whose main point seems to be that there
isn't any error, that the "most parsimonious" tree is the best tree by
definition and that's that).

<p>
The log likelihood printed out with the final tree can be used to
perform various likelihood ratio tests. One can, for example, compare
runs with different values of the expected transition/transversion
ratio to determine which value is the maximum likelihood estimate, and
what is the allowable range of values (using a likelihood ratio test,
which you will find described in mathematical statistics books). One
could also estimate the base frequencies in the same way. Both of
these, particularly the latter, require multiple runs of the program
to evaluate different possible values, and this might get expensive.

<p>
If the U (User Tree) option is used and more than one tree is
supplied, and the program is not told to assume autocorrelation
between the rates at different sites, the program also performs a
statistical test of each of these trees against the one with highest
likelihood. If there are two user trees, the test done is one which is
due to Kishino and Hasegawa (1989), a version of a test originally
introduced by Templeton (1983). In this implementation it uses the
mean and variance of log-likelihood differences between trees, taken
across sites. If the two trees' means are more than 1.96 standard
deviations different then the trees are declared significantly
different. This use of the empirical variance of log-likelihood
differences is more robust and nonparametric than the classical
likelihood ratio test, and may to some extent compensate for the any
lack of realism in the model underlying this program.

<p>
If there are more than two trees, the test done is an extension of the
KHT test, due to Shimodaira and Hasegawa (1999). They pointed out that
a correction for the number of trees was necessary, and they
introduced a resampling method to make this correction. In the version
used here the variances and covariances of the sum of log likelihoods
across sites are computed for all pairs of trees. To test whether the
difference between each tree and the best one is larger than could
have been expected if they all had the same expected log-likelihood,
log-likelihoods for all trees are sampled with these covariances and
equal means (Shimodaira and Hasegawa's "least favorable hypothesis"),
and a P value is computed from the fraction of times the difference
between the tree's value and the highest log-likelihood exceeds that
actually observed. Note that this sampling needs random numbers, and
so the program will prompt the user for a random number seed if one
has not already been supplied. With the two-tree KHT test no random
numbers are used.

<p>
In either the KHT or the SH test the program prints out a table of the
log-likelihoods of each tree, the differences of each from the highest
one, the variance of that quantity as determined by the log-likelihood
differences at individual sites, and a conclusion as to whether that
tree is or is not significantly worse than the best one. However the
test is not available if we assume that there is autocorrelation of
rates at neighboring sites (option A) and is not done in those cases.

<p>
The branch lengths printed out are scaled in terms of expected numbers
of substitutions, counting both transitions and transversions but not
replacements of a base by itself, and scaled so that the average rate
of change, averaged over all sites analyzed, is set to 1.0 if there
are multiple categories of sites. This means that whether or not there
are multiple categories of sites, the expected fraction of change for
very small branches is equal to the branch length. Of course, when a
branch is twice as long this does not mean that there will be twice as
much net change expected along it, since some of the changes occur in
the same site and overlie or even reverse each other. The branch
length estimates here are in terms of the expected underlying numbers
of changes. That means that a branch of length 0.26 is 26 times as
long as one which would show a 1% difference between the nucleotide
sequences at the beginning and end of the branch. But we would not
expect the sequences at the beginning and end of the branch to be 26%
different, as there would be some overlaying of changes.

<p>
Confidence limits on the branch lengths are also given. Of course a
negative value of the branch length is meaningless, and a confidence
limit overlapping zero simply means that the branch length is not
necessarily significantly different from zero. Because of limitations
of the numerical algorithm, branch length estimates of zero will often
print out as small numbers such as 0.00001. If you see a branch length
that small, it is really estimated to be of zero length. Note that
versions 2.7 and earlier of this program printed out the branch
lengths in terms of expected probability of change, so that they were
scaled differently.

<p>
Another possible source of confusion is the existence of negative
values for the log likelihood. This is not really a problem; the log
likelihood is not a probability but the logarithm of a
probability. When it is negative it simply means that the
corresponding probability is less than one (since we are seeing its
logarithm). The log likelihood is maximized by being made more
positive: -30.23 is worse than -29.14.

<p>
At the end of the output, if the R option is in effect with multiple
HMM rates, the program will print a list of what site categories
contributed the most to the final likelihood. This combination of HMM
rate categories need not have contributed a majority of the
likelihood, just a plurality. Still, it will be helpful as a view of
where the program infers that the higher and lower rates are. Note
that the use in this calculations of the prior probabilities of
different rates, and the average patch length, gives this inference a
"smoothed" appearance: some other combination of rates might make a
greater contribution to the likelihood, but be discounted because it
conflicts with this prior information. See the example output below to
see what this printout of rate categories looks like. A second list
will also be printed out, showing for each site which rate accounted
for the highest fraction of the likelihood. If the fraction of the
likelihood accounted for is less than 95%, a dot is printed instead.

<p>
Option 3 in the menu controls whether the tree is printed out into the
output file. This is on by default, and usually you will want to leave
it this way. However for runs with multiple data sets such as
bootstrapping runs, you will primarily be interested in the trees
which are written onto the output tree file, rather than the trees
printed on the output file. To keep the output file from becoming too
large, it may be wisest to use option 3 to prevent trees being printed
onto the output file.

<p>
Option 4 in the menu controls whether the tree estimated by the
program is written onto a tree file. The default name of this output
tree file is "outtree". If the U option is in effect, all the
user-defined trees are written to the output tree file.

<p>
Option 5 in the menu controls whether ancestral states are estimated
at each node in the tree. If it is in effect, a table of ancestral
sequences is printed out (including the sequences in the tip species
which are the input sequences). In that table, if a site has a base
which accounts for more than 95% of the likelihood, it is printed in
capital letters (A rather than a). If the best nucleotide accounts for
less than 50% of the likelihood, the program prints out an ambiguity
code (such as M for "A or C") for the set of nucleotides which, taken
together, account for more half of the likelihood. The ambiguity codes
are listed in the sequence programs documentation file. One limitation
of the current version of the program is that when there are multiple
HMM rates (option R) the reconstructed nucleotides are based on only
the single assignment of rates to sites which accounts for the largest
amount of the likelihood. Thus the assessment of 95% of the
likelihood, in tabulating the ancestral states, refers to 95% of the
likelihood that is accounted for by that particular combination of
rates.

This program is an EMBOSS conversion of a program written by Joe
Felsenstein as part of his PHYLIP package.

<p>
Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
before publication.

<p>
Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
not to the original author.

<H2>
    History
