This is an EMBOSS port of the PHYLIP 3.69 package from Joe Felsenstein
at the University of Washington.

The original version of PHYLIP os available from
http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip/software.html

The EMBOSS port involves replacing the user interface with an EMBOSS
ACD file and using EMBOSS to parse the input data. Once data has been
loaded, all the algorithms and outputs use the original PHYLIP code.

In a future release we may add EMBOSS output code so that the user has
a choice of output formats.

The EMBOSS versions of the programs all have 'f' added to the start of
the name so you can run native PHYLIP on the same system to check your
results.
