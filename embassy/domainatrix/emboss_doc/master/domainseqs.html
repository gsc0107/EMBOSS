DOMAINSEQS parses a DCF file (domain classification file) and writes a file 
containing the same data, except that domain sequence 
information derived from structural and, optionally, sequence databases are
added.  
Domain sequences are taken from domain CCF files (clean coordinate files) 
and (optionally) the swissprot database.  

If the swissprot sequence is used, DOMAINSEQS requires a swissprot:PDB 
equivalence file that gives the accession number of each PDB file 
corresponding to the domains in the DCF file.  

The path for the CCF files (input) and names of DCF files (input and output) are specified by the user.  A log file is also written.






<!-- INPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of input file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.

     Cannot use the test data files because they might be empty or need 
     hand-editing

DOMAINSEQS may add the following records:
<UL>
<LI>(1) AC - Accession number of the domain sequence.  This record will only 
be present if the DCF file has been processed using 
DOMAINSEQS and if an accession number for the PDB file corresponding to the 
domain is given in the swissprot:PDB equivalence file (generated by 
PDBTOSP) that DOMAINSEQS makes use of.
<LI>(2) SP - Swissprot code of the domain sequence.  This record will only 
be present if the domain classification file has been processed using 
DOMAINSEQS and if an swissprot code for the PDB file corresponding to the 
domain is given in the swissprot:PDB equivalence file (generated by 
PDBTOSP) that DOMAINSEQS makes use of.
<LI>(3) RA - Position of domain in swissprot sequence.  The integers 
preceeding START and END give the start and end points respectively of the
domain sequence relative to the full-length swissprot sequence.
<LI>(4) SQ - Sequence of the domain according to swissprot.  This sequence
is taken from the swissprot database.  The SQ record will only be 
present if the SCOP classification file has been processed using 
DOMAINSEQS and if an accession number for the PDB file corresponding to the 
domain is given in the swissprot:PDB equivalence file (generated by 
PDBTOSP) that DOMAINSEQS makes use of.

An example of interactive use of DOMAINSEQS is shown below.

<!--#include file="inc/domainseqs.usage" -->

<br><br>
<!-- The DCF file (domain classification file) lacking sequence information called /test_data/all.scop was parsed and a DCF file with sequence information called /test_data/domainseqs/all_s.scop was written.  The file Epdbtosp.dat was queried for accession numbers of PDB files corresponding to the domains in all.scop, but no accession numbers were found for either of the domains d1ii7a_ or d1cs4a_.  A log file called /test_data/domainseqs/domainseqs.log was written. -->



<!-- KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS
     Bugs that have not yet been fixed, easily missued features, problems
     and caveats etc. Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.

<a name="7.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 7.0   KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS     </H2>

The swissprot:PDB equivalence file available as part of the EMBOSS
distribution does not contain accession numbers for all PDB files and covers
only a relatively small proportion of domains in SCOP.




<!-- NOTES
     Important general remarks, including:
       Restrictions.
       Interesting behaviour.
       Useful things you can do with this program.

<br><br><br><H2> 8.0   NOTES                     </H2>


DOMAINSEQS will not attempt to retrieve a swissprot sequence for any domains 
comprised of more than a single segment, i.e. for domains whose NC record 
in the DCF file has a value other than 1 
(see <a href="scopparse.html">SCOPPARSE documentation</a>).
<br>
The region of sequence to retrieve is identified by alignment of the sequence from the
CCF file (structural database) to the full length sequences in swissprot.   If this were to be done
for segmented domains, the start and end point for the retrieved sequence 
(relative to the full length sequence) might actually include a completely 
different domain.
<br><br>
Consider :
<br> (A) represents a sequence from the coordinate file for a segmented domain D1
<br> (B) represents the full-length swissprot sequence, it includes D1, but D1 is
 split by a second domain D2
<pre> 
                 D1
  (A)  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  
          D1         D2        D1
  (B) XXXXXXXXXX-----------XXXXXXXXXXX
</pre>
  
 It should be clear that for an alignment retrieving B, the start and end 
 points for the retrieved sequence would be misleading.

<br><br>
The user should be aware that sequences from the domain CCF file
for domains comprised of more than a single segment are not biologically 
significant, as the sequences are derived from different segments of one or
more chains.  However, such sequences might be acceptable for redundancy 
calculations (e.g. by using <a href="domainnr.html">DOMAINNR</a>) because 
two redundant domains made of similar fragments will have similar sequences, 
so the redundancy should be detectable.

<!-- DESCRIPTION
     A complete, non-technical, user-level description of the application.
-->
<a name="9.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 9.0   DESCRIPTION               </H2>

Domain sequences are not given in the raw SCOP or CATH parsable files, but are
required for many analyses and for convenience should, ideally, be provided
along with the classification itself.  DOMAINSEQS reads a DCF file (domain 
classificaiton file) that lacks sequence information and writes one 
containing sequence information.





<!-- ALGORITHM
     A technical description of algorithmic aspects, describing exactly how
     the key aspects of the application work.
-->
<a name="10.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 10.0  ALGORITHM                 </H2>

In order to find the start and end of a domain in a sequence from swissprot, 
the domain sequence from the domain CCF file is aligned to the 
full length protein sequence from swissprot.  Alignment is performed first
by string handling and if that fails, by using the EMBOSS implementation of
the Needleman and Wunsch global alignment algorithm.  Gap insertion and 
extension penalties used in the alignments are user-specified.




<!-- RELATED APPLICATIONS
