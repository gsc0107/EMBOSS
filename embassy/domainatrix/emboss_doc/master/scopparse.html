SCOPPARSE parses the dir.cla.scop.txt and dir.des.scop.txt SCOP 
classification files, e.g. available at URLs:
<br> http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/dir.cla.scop.txt_1.57
<br>    http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/dir.des.scop.txt_1.57
<br>
<br>
The format of these files is explained at URL:
<br> http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/release-notes-1.55.html
<br>
<br>SCOPPARSE writes the classification to a DCF file (EMBL-like format).  
No changes are made to the data other than changing the 
format in which it is held.  The file does not include domain sequence 
information.  The input and output files are specified by the user.





<!-- INPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of input file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.
     Use "<b>SCOPPARSE</b> reads any normal sequence USAs." if
     appropriate.

<!-- OUTPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of output file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.  
     If the standard description of the avalable report formats is required, 
     use:   #include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml"
     Use "Outputs a graph to the specified graphics device."
     or  "outputs a report format file. The default format is ..."

-->
<a name="4.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 4.0   OUTPUT FILE FORMAT         </H2>
An example of the DCF output file is shown in Figure 3.
The records used to describe an entry are as follows.  Records (4) to (9) 
are used to describe the position of the domain in the SCOP hierarchy.
Various other <a href="#8.3"> ADDITIONAL RECORDS </a> may be present if the 
file is processed by other programs, e.g. DOMAINSEQS or DOMAINSSE.


<UL>
<LI>(1)  ID - Domain identifier code.  This is a 7-character code that uniquely
identifies the domain in SCOP.  It is identical to the first 7 characters 
of a line in the SCOP classification file.  The first character is always 
'D', the next four characters are the PDB identifier code, the fifth 
character is the PDB chain identifier to which the domain belongs (a '.' is
given in cases where the domain is composed of multiple chains, a '_' is 
given where a chain identifier was not specified in the PDB file) and the 
final character is the number of the domain in the chain (for chains 
comprising more than one domain) or '_' (the chain comprises a single 
domain only).
<LI>(2)  EN - PDB identifier code.  This is the 4-character PDB identifier code
of the PDB entry containing the domain.
<LI>(3) TY - domain type.  "CATH" or "SCOP" is given ("SCOP" for DCF files 
generated by using SCOPPARSE).
<LI>(4)  SI - SCOP Sunid's.  The integers preceeding the codes CL, FO, SF, FA,
DO, SO and DD are the SCOP sunids for Class, Fold, Superfamily, Family, 
Domain, Source and domain data respectively. These numbers uniquely 
identify the appropriate node in the SCOP parsable files.
<LI>(5)  CL - Domain class.  It is identical to the text given after 'Class' in 
the SCOP classification file.
<LI>(6)  FO - Domain fold.  It is identical to the text given after 'Fold' in 
the SCOP classification file.
<LI>(7)  SF - Domain superfamily.  It is identical to the text given after 
'Superfamily' in the SCOP classification file.
<LI>(8)  FA - Domain family. It is identical to the text given after 'Family' 
in the SCOP classification file.
<LI>(9)  DO - Domain name. It is identical to the text given after 'Protein' in 
the SCOP classification file.
<LI>(10) OS - Source of the protein.  It is identical to the text given after 
'Species' in the SCOP classification file.
<LI>(11) DS - Sequence of the domain according to the PDB file.  This sequence
is taken from the domain clean coordinate file generated by DOMAINER.  The DS    
record will only be present if the DCF file has been 
processed using DOMAINSEQS.
<LI>(12) NC - Number of chains comprising the domain, or number of segments 
from the same chain that the domain is comprised of.  NC is usually 1.  If
the number of chains is greater than 1, then the domain entry will have a 
section  containing a CN and a CH record (see below) for each chain.
<LI>(13) CN - Chain number.  The number given in brackets after this record 
indicates the start of the data for the relevent chain.
<LI>(14) CH - Domain definition.  The character given before CHAIN is the PDB 
chain identifier (a '.' is given in cases where a chain identifier was not 
specified in the DCF file), the strings before START and 
END give the start and end positions respectively of the domain in the PDB 
file (a '.' is given in cases where a position was not specified).  Note 
that the start and end positions refer to residue numbering given in the 
original PDB file and therefore must be treated as strings.
<LI>(15) XX - used for spacing.
<LI>(16) // - used to delimit records for a domain.
</UL>

<br><br><br><H2> 8.0   NOTES                     </H2>
Some SCOP domains are comprised of more than one segments of polypeptide 
chain, these segments belonging to a single or more than one polypeptide 
chains.  It is debatable whether a domain (using the widely accepted 
definition) can truly consist of regions from more than polypeptide. 
Accordingly, SCOPPARSE gives the option of omitting from the output file 
domains that consist of more than one segment and domains that consist
of more than one segment where the segments are from different chains.
<br><br>
SCOP includes several minor classes which are not appropriate for some
anaylses.  Accordingly, SCOPPARSE gives the option to omit domains from 
minor classes.  This is defined as anything not in class 'All alpha 
proteins', 'All beta proteins', 'Alpha and beta proteins (a/b)' or 'Alpha 
and beta proteins (a+b)'

The following records for database sequence and secondary structure may be
present in a DCF file that has been processed by using DOMAINSEQS or DOMAINSSE.
<br>
<UL>
<LI>(1) AC - Accession number of the domain sequence.  This record will only 
be present if the DCF file has been processed using 
DOMAINSEQS and if an accession number for the PDB file corresponding to the 
domain is given in the swissprot:PDB equivalence file (generated by 
PDBTOSP) that DOMAINSEQS makes use of.
<LI>(2) SP - Swissprot code of the domain sequence.  This record will only 
be present if the domain classification file has been processed using 
DOMAINSEQS and if an swissprot code for the PDB file corresponding to the 
domain is given in the swissprot:PDB equivalence file (generated by 
PDBTOSP) that DOMAINSEQS makes use of.
<LI>(3) RA - Position of domain in swissprot sequence.  The integers 
preceeding START and END give the start and end points respectively of the
domain sequence relative to the full-length swissprot sequence.
<LI>(4) SQ - Sequence of the domain according to swissprot.  This sequence
is taken from the swissprot database.  The SQ record will only be 
present if the SCOP classification file has been processed using 
DOMAINSEQS and if an accession number for the PDB file corresponding to the 
domain is given in the swissprot:PDB equivalence file (generated by 
PDBTOSP) that DOMAINSEQS makes use of.
<LI>(5) SS - Secondary structure assignment (per residue). A simplified 3-state assignment:
H (helix), E (extended, beta strand) and L (loop, open coil) is used. 
<LI>(6) SE - Secondary structure element assignment (per secondary structure element).
The same 3-state assignment as for the SS record is used:
H (helix), E (extended, beta strand) and L (loop, open coil).

<!-- DESCRIPTION

-->
<a name="9.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 9.0   DESCRIPTION               </H2>
The raw SCOP classification files are inconvenient for some uses because 
the text describing the domain classification is given in a different file
to the classification itself, the file formats are not easily extended and
differ from other related classifications such as CATH.
SCOPPARSE reads the raw SCOP classification files and writes a single file
in DCF (EMBL-like) format, which is an easier format to work with, is more 
human-readable and is more extensible than the native SCOP database format.
