   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-classfile]         infile     This option specifies the name of raw SCOP
                                  classification file dir.cla.scop.txt_X.XX
                                  (input). This is the raw SCOP classification
                                  file available at
                                  http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/dir.cla.scop.txt_1.57.
  [-desinfile]         infile     This option specifies the name of raw SCOP
                                  description file dir.des.scop.txt_X.XX
                                  (input). This is the raw SCOP description
                                  file available at
                                  http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/dir.des.scop.txt_1.57.
   -nosegments         boolean    [N] This option specifies whether to omit
                                  domains comprising of more than one segment.
                                  This is necessary if a continuous residue
                                  sequence is required.
   -nomultichain       boolean    [N] This option specifies whether to omit
                                  domains comprising segments from more than
                                  one chain. This is necessary if a continuous
                                  residue sequence is required.
  [-dcffile]           outfile    [test.scop] This option specifies the name
                                  of SCOP DCF file (domain classification
                                  file) (output). A 'domain classification
                                  file' contains classification and other data
                                  for domains from the SCOP or CATH
                                  databases. The file is generated by using
                                  DOMAINER and is in DCF format (EMBL-like).
                                  Domain sequence information can be added to
                                  the file by using DOMAINSEQS.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -nominor            boolean    [N] This option specifies whether to omit
                                  domains from minor classes (defined as
                                  anything not in class 'All alpha proteins',
                                  'All beta proteins', 'Alpha and beta
                                  proteins (a/b)' or 'Alpha and beta proteins
                                  (a+b)'). This is necessary or appropriate
                                  for many analyses.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers: (none)

                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
