   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-dcfinfile]         infile     This option specifies the name of DCF file
                                  (domain classification file) (input). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
  [-pdbdir]            directory  This option specifies the location of domain
                                  PDB files (input). A 'domain PDB file'
                                  contains coordinate data for a single domain
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in PDB format. The files
                                  are generated by using DOMAINER.
   -node               menu       This option specifies the node for
                                  redundancy removal. Redundancy can be
                                  removed at any specified node in the SCOP or
                                  CATH hierarchies. For example by selecting
                                  'Class' entries belonging to the same Class
                                  will be non-redundant.
   -mode               menu       This option specifies the alignment
                                  algorithm to use.
   -[no]keepsinglets   toggle     This option specifies whether to write
                                  sequences of singlet families to file. If
                                  you specify this option, the sequence for
                                  each singlet family are written to file
                                  (output).
*  -singletsoutdir     outdir     This option specifies the location of DHF
                                  files (domain hits files) for singlet
                                  sequences (output). The singlets are written
                                  out as a 'domain hits file' - which
                                  contains database hits (sequences) with
                                  domain classification information, in FASTA
                                  format.
  [-dafoutdir]         outdir     This option specifies the location of DAF
                                  files (domain alignment files) (output). A
                                  'domain alignment file' contains a sequence
                                  alignment of domains belonging to the same
                                  SCOP or CATH family. The files are in
                                  clustal format and are annotated with domain
                                  family classification information. The
                                  files generated by using SCOPALIGN will
                                  contain a structure-based sequence alignment
                                  of domains of known structure only. Such
                                  alignments can be extended with sequence
                                  relatives (of unknown structure) by using
                                  SEQALIGN.
*  -superoutdir        outdir     This option specifies the location of
                                  structural superimposition files (output). A
                                  file in PDB format of the structural
                                  superimposition is generated for each family
                                  if the STAMP algorithm is used.
   -logfile            outfile    This option specifies the name of log file
                                  (output). The log file contains messages
                                  about any errors arising while domainalign
                                  ran.
