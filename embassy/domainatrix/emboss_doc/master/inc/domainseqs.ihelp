   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-dcfinfile]         infile     This option specifies the name of DCF file
                                  (domain classification file) (input). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
  [-dpdbdir]           directory  This option specifies the location of domain
                                  CCF file (clean coordinate files) (input).
                                  A 'clean cordinate file' contains coordinate
                                  and other data for a single PDB file or a
                                  single domain from SCOP or CATH, in CCF
                                  format (EMBL-like). The files, generated by
                                  using PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER
                                  (domains), contain 'cleaned-up' data that is
                                  self-consistent and error-corrected.
                                  Records for residue solvent accessibility
                                  and secondary structure are added to the
                                  file by using PDBPLUS.
   -getswiss           toggle     Retrieve swissprot sequence.
*  -pdbtospfile        infile     This option specifies the name of the
                                  pdbcodes to swissprot indexing file. The
                                  swissprot:PDB equivalence file is generated
                                  by PDBTOSP
  [-dcfoutfile]        outfile    This option specifies the name of DCF file
                                  (domain classification file) (output). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   -logfile            outfile    This option specifies the name of log file
                                  for the build. The log file contains
                                  messages about any errors arising while
                                  domainseqs ran.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
*  -datafile           matrixf    This option specifies the residue
                                  substitution matrix, which is used for
                                  sequence comparison.
*  -gapopen            float      This option specifies the gap insertion
                                  penalty. This is the score taken away when a
                                  gap is created. The best value depends on
                                  the choice of comparison matrix. The default
                                  value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62
                                  matrix for protein sequences, and the
                                  EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences.
*  -gapextend          float      This option specifies the gap extension
                                  penalty. This is added to the standard gap
                                  penalty for each base or residue in the gap.
                                  This is how long gaps are penalized.
                                  Usually you will expect a few long gaps
                                  rather than many short gaps, so the gap
                                  extension penalty should be lower than the
                                  gap penalty.
