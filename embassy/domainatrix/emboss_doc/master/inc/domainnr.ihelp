   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-dcfinfile]         infile     This option specifies name of DCF file
                                  (domain classification file) (input). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   -retain             toggle     [N] This option specifies whether to write
                                  redundant domains to a separate file. If
                                  this option is selected, redundant domains
                                  are written to a separate output file.
   -node               menu       [1] This option specifies the node for
                                  redundancy removal. Redundancy can be
                                  removed at any specified node in the SCOP or
                                  CATH hierarchies. For example by selecting
                                  'Class' entries belonging to the same Class
                                  will be non-redundant. (Values: 1 (Class
                                  (SCOP)); 2 (Fold (SCOP)); 3 (Superfamily
                                  (SCOP)); 4 (Family (SCOP)); 5 (Class
                                  (CATH)); 6 (Architecture (CATH)); 7
                                  (Topology (CATH)); 8 (Homologous Superfamily
                                  (CATH)); 9 (Family (CATH)))
   -mode               menu       [1] This option specifies whether to remove
                                  redundancy at a single threshold % sequence
                                  similarity or remove redundancy outside a
                                  range of acceptable threshold % similarity.
                                  All permutations of pair-wise sequence
                                  alignments are calculated for each domain
                                  family in turn using the EMBOSS
                                  implementation of the Needleman and Wunsch
                                  global alignment algorithm. Redundant
                                  sequences are removed in one of two modes as
                                  follows: (i) If a pair of proteins achieve
                                  greater than a threshold percentage sequence
                                  similarity (specified by the user) the
                                  shortest sequence is discarded. (ii) If a
                                  pair of proteins have a percentage sequence
                                  similarity that lies outside an acceptable
                                  range (specified by the user) the shortest
                                  sequence is discarded. (Values: 1 (Remove
                                  redundancy at a single threshold % sequence
                                  similarity); 2 (Remove redundancy outside a
                                  range of acceptable threshold % similarity))
*  -threshold          float      [95.0] This option specifies the % sequence
                                  identity redundancy threshold, which
                                  determines the redundancy calculation. If a
                                  pair of proteins achieve greater than this
                                  threshold the shortest sequence is
                                  discarded. (Any numeric value)
*  -threshlow          float      [30.0] This option specifies the % sequence
                                  identity redundancy threshold, which
                                  determines the redundancy calculation. If a
                                  pair of proteins have a percentage sequence
                                  similarity that lies outside an acceptable
                                  range the shortest sequence is discarded.
                                  (Any numeric value)
*  -threshup           float      [90.0] This option specifies the % sequence
                                  identity redundancy threshold, which
                                  determines the redundancy calculation. If a
                                  pair of proteins have a percentage sequence
                                  similarity that lies outside an acceptable
                                  range the shortest sequence is discarded.
                                  (Any numeric value)
  [-dcfoutfile]        outfile    [test.scop] This option specifies the name
                                  of non-redundant DCF file (domain
                                  classification file) (output). A 'domain
                                  classification file' contains classification
                                  and other data for domains from SCOP or
                                  CATH, in DCF format (EMBL-like). The files
                                  are generated by using SCOPPARSE and
                                  CATHPARSE. Domain sequence information can
                                  be added to the file by using DOMAINSEQS.
*  -redoutfile         outfile    [*.domainnr] This option specifies the name
                                  of DCF file (domain classification file) for
                                  redundant sequences (output). A 'domain
                                  classification file' contains classification
                                  and other data for domains from SCOP or
                                  CATH, in DCF format (EMBL-like). The files
                                  are generated by using SCOPPARSE and
                                  CATHPARSE. Domain sequence information can
                                  be added to the file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   -logfile            outfile    [domainnr.log] This option specifies the
                                  name of log file for the build. The log file
                                  contains messages about any errors arising
                                  while domainnr ran.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -datafile           matrixf    [EBLOSUM62] This option specifies the
                                  residue substitution matrix. This is used
                                  for sequence comparison.
   -gapopen            float      [10.0 for any sequence] This option
                                  specifies the gap insertion penalty. This is
                                  the score taken away when a gap is created.
                                  The best value depends on the choice of
                                  comparison matrix. The default value assumes
                                  you are using the EBLOSUM62 matrix for
                                  protein sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix
                                  for nucleotide sequences. (Floating point
                                  number from 1.0 to 100.0)
   -gapextend          float      [0.5 for any sequence] This option specifies
                                  the gap extension penalty. This is added to
                                  the standard gap penalty for each base or
                                  residue in the gap. This is how long gaps
                                  are penalized. Usually you will expect a few
                                  long gaps rather than many short gaps, so
                                  the gap extension penalty should be lower
                                  than the gap penalty. (Floating point number
                                  from 0.0 to 10.0)
