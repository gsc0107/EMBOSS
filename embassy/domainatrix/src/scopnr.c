**  Application name
**  scopnr 
**
**  
**  
**  Summary
**  Removes redundant domains from a scop classification file.
**
**  
**  
**  Input and Output
**  scopnr reads a scop classification file containing domain sequence 
**  information and writes a file containing the same data in the same embl-like
**  format, except that redundant domains are removed from each family.  The 
**  input and output files are specified by the user.  A log file is also 
**  written.
**
**  
**   
**  Sister applications
**  A 'scop classification file' contains classification and other data for 
**  domains from the scop database.  The file is in embl-like format and is 
**  generated by scopparse.  Domain sequence information can be added to the 
**  file by using scopseqs.
**  domainer, funky, scopreso, scopseqs, scoprep, scopalign, seqsearch, seqnr 
**  and seqalign use a scop classification file as input.  
**  
**
**  
**  Notes
**  The current version of scopnr removes redundancy at the level of the scop 
**  family, i.e. entries belonging to the same family will be non-redundant.  
**  
**  
**  
**  Known bugs & warnings

**  
**  
**  Description
**  This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly or 
**  indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and scop.  
**  This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline described in an
**  accompanying document.  We provide the software in the hope that it will
**  be useful.  The applications were designed for specific research purposes
**  and may not be useful or reliable in contexts other than the described 
**  pipeline.  The development of the suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to
**  whom enquiries and bug reports should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).
**  
**  The inclusion of very similar sequences in certain analyses will introduce
**  undesirable bias.  For example, a family may possess 100 sequences in the 
**  sequence database, but 90 of these might be essentially the same sequence,
**  e.g. very close relatives or mutations of a single sequence.  Although 100
**  sequences are known, the family only contains 11 sequences that are 
**  essentially unique.  For many methods it is desirable to use sets of 
**  sequences that are truly representative of the larger family.  scopnr reads
**  a scop classification file and writes a scop classification file with 
**  redundant domains removed from each family.
**  
**  
**  
**  Algorithm
**  All permutations of pair-wise sequence alignments are calculated for each 
**  scop family in turn using the EMBOSS implementation of the Needleman and 
**  Wunsch global alignment algorithm.  Redundant sequences are removed in one
**  of two modes as follows: (i) If a pair of proteins achieve greater 
**  than a threshold percentage sequence similarity (specified by the user) 
**  the shortest sequence is discarded. (ii) If a pair of proteins have a 
**  percentage sequence similarity that lies outside an acceptable range 
**  (specified by the user) the shortest sequence is discarded.
**  The user must specify gap insertion 
**  and extension penalties and a residue substitution matrix for use in the 
**  alignments.  % sequence similarity is calculated by using the EMBOSS 
**  function embAlignCalcSimilarity.
**  
**  
**  
**  Usage 
**  An example of interactive use of scopnr is shown below.
**  
**  Unix % 
**  Unix % scopnr
**  Removes redundant domains from a scop classification file.
**  Name of scop classification file (embl format input): /test_data/all_s.scop
**  Redundancy removal options
**           1 : Remove redundancy at a single threshold % sequence similarity
**           2 : Remove redundancy outside a range of acceptable threshold % similarity
**  Select number [1]: 1
**  The % sequence identity redundancy threshold [95.0]: 
**  Name of non-redundant scop classification file (embl format output) [test.scop]: /test_data/all_nr.scop
**  Name of log file for the build [scopnr.log]: /test_data/scopnr.log
**  // DNA double-strand break repair nuclease
**  D1II7A_
**  // Adenylyl and guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain
**  D1CS4A_
**  Unix % 
**  
**  The scop classification file /test_data/all_s.scop with families containing
**  redundant domains was read and a scop classificaiton called 
**  /test_data/all_nr.scop was written in which redundant domains were removed
**  from each family.  A redundant domain was one sharing at least 95% sequence
**  similarity to another domain.  The log file /test_data/scopnr.log was 
**  written.
**  
**  The following command line would achieve the same result.
**  scopnr  /test_data/all_s.scop /test_data/all_nr.scop -mode 1 -thresh 95 
**  -errf /test_data/scopnr.log
**  
**  
**  
**  Input file format
**  The format of the scop classification file is described in scopparse.c
**  
**  
**  
**  Output file format
**  The format of the scop classification file is described in scopparse.c
**  
**  
**  
**  Data files
**  scopnr requires a residue substitution matrix.
**  
**  
**  
**  Diagnostic error messages
**  scopnr generates a log file an excerpt of which is shown below. The 
**  first two lines describe the level in the scop hierarchy at which redundancy 
**  was removed (always 'FAMILIES' for the current implementation) and the value
**  of the redundancy threshold.  The file then contains a section for each scop 
**  family. Each section contains a line with the record '//' immediately 
**  followed by the name of the scop family, and two lines containing 'Retained' 
**  and 'Rejected' respectively. Domain identifier codes of domains that were 
**  discarded by scopnr are listed under 'Rejected' while those that appear in 
**  the output file are listed under 'Retained'.  The text 'WARN  filename not 
**  found' is given in cases where a clean domain coordinate file could not be 
**  found and 'WARN  Empty family' where no files for an entire family could be 
**  found.  'ERROR filename file read error' will be given when an error was 
**  encountered during a file read.
