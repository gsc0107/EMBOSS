**  Summary
**  Reads a scop families file and a scop ambiguities file and writes (i) a 
**  non-redundant scop families file and (ii) a scop validation file.
**  
**  
**  
**  Input and Output
**  seqnr reads a scop families file, a scop ambiguities file and a directory 
**  of scop family alignment files.  Each alignment file should contain a 
**  structure-based sequence alignment of domains of known structure for a 
**  particular scop family.  The directory should contain an alignment for each
**  family in the scop families file.  
**  seqnr writes (i) a scop validation file, which contains all the hits from 
**  the scop families and ambiguities files, plus hits corresponding to 
**  sequences in the alignment.  Depending on the mode it is run in it may also
**  generate (ii) a scop families file in which non-redundant domains are 
**  removed from each family.  A scop classification must also be provided and
**  is the source of domain information for sequences from the alignment files.
**  seqnr ensures that sequences from the alignments are (i) excluded from the
**  scop families file, (ii) included in the validation file (if they do not 
**  already correspond to a prexisting hit) and (iii) are considered for 
**  purposes of calculating redundancy.  The path and extension of the 
**  alignment files are specified by the user.  A log file is also written.
**
**  
** 
**  Sister applications
**  A 'scop families file' contains sequence relatives (hits) for each of a 
**  number of different scop families found from psiblast searches of a 
**  sequence database.  The file contains the collated search results for the
**  indvidual scop families; only those hits of unambiguous family assignment
**  are included.  Hits of ambiguous family assignment are assigned as 
**  relatives to a scop superfamily or fold instead and are collated into a 
**  'scop ambiguities file'.  The scop families and ambiguities files are 
**  generated by seqsort and are in embl-like format.
**  A 'scop classification file' contains classification and other data for 
**  domains from the scop database.  The file is in embl-like format and is 
**  generated by scopparse.
**  A 'scop family alignment file' contains a sequence alignment of domains 
**  belonging to the same scop family.  The file is in embl-like format and is
**  annotated with records describing the SCOP classification of the family.  A
**  scop family alignment file generatd by scopalign will contain a structure-
**  based sequence alignment of domains of known structure only.  Such 
**  alignments can be extended with sequence relatives (of unknown structure)
**  to the family in question by using seqalign.
**  The scop families file is used by seqalign  
**  The scop validation file is used by modelscan, sigscan and sigplot.
**  
**  
**  
**  Notes
**  
**  
**  
**  Known bugs & warnings
**  Care must be taken when validating signatures from structure-based sequence
**  alignments, as some families in the validation file will not contain the
**  same number of SEEDs as sequences in the scop alignment file.  This is 
**  because accession numbers may not be given in the swissprot:pdb equivalence
**  table for all domains in the scop alignment file.
** 
**   
**  
**  Description
**  This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly or 
**  indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and scop.  
**  This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline described in an
**  accompanying document.  We provide the software in the hope that it will
**  be useful.  The applications were designed for specific research purposes
**  and may not be useful or reliable in contexts other than the described 
**  pipeline.  The development of the suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to
**  whom enquiries and bug reports should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).
**  
**  Reads a scop families file and a scop ambiguities file and writes (i) a 
**  non-redundant scop families file and (ii) a scop validation file.
** 
**  
**   
**  Algorithm
**  Redundancy is calculated for each family in the scop families file in turn.
**  Sequences in the scop alignment file corresponding to the family are 
**  considered when calculating redundancy in a process of 4 steps as follows.
**  (1) A list of Scop objects for domains in the alignment file is compiled by
**  opening the appropriate scop alignment file, extracting the scop domain 
**  codes, querying the scop classification file and retrieving the 
**  corresponding scop domains.  These domains are then pushed onto a list. 
**  (2) This list is then merged with a list of domains for the family taken 
**  from the scop families input file.  (3) The merged list is then sorted and
**  one of any pair of sequences that are identical or overlapping is removed.
**  Such overlaps will only arise with sequences from the alignment file, other
**  overlaps having been processed by seqsort (used to generate the scop 
**  families and ambiguities files that are input to seqnr). (4) Redundant 
**  domains are then identified.  
**  
**  seqnr always writes a scop validation file, which contains all the hits 
**  from the scop families and ambiguities files, plus hits corresponding to
**  sequences in the alignment file.  To avoid introducing duplicate hits in
**  the validation file when incorporating hits from the alignment, any hits
**  that have an identical accession number to an alignment sequence and which
**  overlap by at least a user-defined number of residues will NOT be included.
**  Note that the validation file must only contains hits with known accession
**  numbers.  Therefore if an accession number could not be assigned to a hit
**  from the alignment file, then that hit will NOT appear in the validation 
**  file, and a message to the log file will be written. Such cases will arise
**  where the pdb code corresponding to a hit is not listed in the 
**  swissprot:pdb equivalence table, Epdbtosp.dat. The hits in the scop 
**  families will normally have been found by a search against swissprot and 
**  therefore should all have accession numbers.  
**  
**  Hits in the validation file are flagged as NON_REDUNDANT or REDUNDANT as 
**  appropriate.  They are then flagged as 'SEED' or left as 'HIT' depending 
**  on whether the file will be used to validate signatures generated from (i)
**  structure-based sequence alignemnts (mode 1) or (ii) extended alignments 
**  (mode 2).  For mode 1, hits corresponding to sequences from the alignment 
**  files only are marked up as 'SEED'.  For mode 2, hits corresponding to 
**  sequences from the alignment file plus non-redundant sequences from the 
**  scop families input file, i.e. all the sequences in the scop families 
**  output file, will be marked up as 'SEED'.
**  
**  If seqnr is run in mode 2 it will generate a scop families file, which is
**  identical to the scop families input file, except that redundant domains 
**  are removed from each family, and sequences corresponding to domains from
**  the alignment file are also excluded.  (An extended alignment for each 
**  family can be built by using alignwrap, which extends the scop alignment
**  files with sequences from the scop families output file).
**  
**  
**  
**  Usage 
**  An example of interactive use of seqnr is shown below.
**  
**  Unix % seqnr
**  Reads a scop families file and a scop ambiguities file and writes (i) a
**  non-redundant scop families file and (ii) a scop validation file.
**  Name of the scop families file (input): /test_data/scop.fam
**  Name of ambiguities file (input): /test_data/scop.oth
**  Name of scop classification file (embl format input): /test_data/all.scop2
**  Location of scop alignment files (input) [./]: /test_data/     
**  Extension of scop alignment files [.salign]: 
**  number of overlapping residues required to define two hits as 'overlapping' [10]: 20
**  The % sequence identity redundancy threshold [95.0]: 40
**  Mode of operation
**           1 : Validation file for signatures from structure-based sequence alignemnts (no scop families file)
**           2 : Validation file for signatures from extended alignments (plus non-redundant scop families file)
**  Select mode [1]: 1
**  Name of validation file (output) [test.valid.out]: /test_data/scop.all
**  Name seqnr log file (output) [seqnr.log]: /test_data/seqnr.log
**  Processing 55074
**  Warning: Sequence length smaller than overlap limit in embDmxScophitsOverlapAcc
**  Warning: Sequence length smaller than overlap limit in embDmxScophitsOverlapAcc
**  Warning: Zero length sequence in SeqNR
**  Processing 54894
**  Warning: Sequence length smaller than overlap limit in embDmxScophitsOverlapAcc
**  Warning: Sequence length smaller than overlap limit in embDmxScophitsOverlapAcc
**  Warning: Zero length sequence in SeqNR
**  Unix % 
**  
**  Scop famililes and validation files called /test_data/scop.fam
**  and /test_data/scop.oth respectively were read and a 
**  validation file (containing the collated contents of scop.fam and scop.oth)
**  called /test_data/scop.all was written.  Scop alignment files
**  with the file extension .salign were read from the directory 
**  /test_data/.  Domain information for sequences from the 
**  alignment files was taken from the scop classification file 
**  /test_data/all.scop2.  When checking for overlaps between 
**  sequences from the scop families input file and the alignment files, a 
**  shared segment of 20 or more identical was required to class two sequences
**  as overlapping.  Two domains within the same family are classified as 
**  redundant if they share at least 40% sequence similarity;  the default 
**  residue substitution matrix EBLOSUM62 and default gap insertion and 
**  extension penalties were used for the alignments.  
**  seqnr was run in mode 1, i.e. a validation file for signatures from 
**  structure-based sequence alignemnt was generated and non non-redundant scop
**  families file was generated.
**  
**  The following command line would achieve the same result.
**  seqnr /test_data/scop.fam /test_data/scop.oth /test_data/scop.all -scopin 
**  /test_data/all.scop2 -alignpath /test_data/ -alignextn .salign -overlap 20
**  -thresh 40 -mode 1 -logf seqnr.log
**  
**  
**  
**  Input file format
**  The format of the scop families and ambiguities files is described in 
**  seqsort.c.
**  The format of the scop classification file is described in scopparse.c
**  The format of the scop alignment file is described in scopalign.c
**  
**  
**  
**  Output file format
**  The format of the scop validation (see below) is exactly the same as the
**  scop families file, described in seqsearch.c.  However, data for multiple
**  families, superfamilies or folds may occur in the file. Data for each 
**  family etc will be delimited by the record '//' on its own line.  Where a
**  list of hits to a superfamily or fold is given, clearly that entry will 
**  lack the FA (family description) or FA and SF (superfamily description)
**  records respectively.
