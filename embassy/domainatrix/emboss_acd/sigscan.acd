           Usually you will expect a few long gaps rather than many short
           gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be lower than the gap
           penalty. An exception is where one or both sequences are single
           reads with possible sequencing errors in which case you would
           expect many single base gaps. You can get this result by setting
           the gap open penalty to zero (or very low) and using the gap
