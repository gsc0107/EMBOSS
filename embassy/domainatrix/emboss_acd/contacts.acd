A 'clean cordinate file' contains protein coordinate and derived data for a single PDB file ('protein clean coordinate file') or a single domain from SCOP or CATH ('domain clean coordinate file'), in CCF format (EMBL-like).  The files, generated by using PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER (domains), contain 'cleaned-up' data that is self-consistent and error-corrected. Records for residue solvent accessibility and secondary structure are added to the file by using PDBPLUS."
