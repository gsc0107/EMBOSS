	help: "A 'scop family alignment file' contains a sequence alignment of domains belonging to the same scop family.  The file is in embl-like format and is annotated with records describing the SCOP classification of the family.  A scop family alignment file generatd by scopalign will contain a structure-based sequence alignment of domains of known structure only.  Such alignments can be extended with sequence relatives (of unknown structure) to the family in question by using seqalign."
