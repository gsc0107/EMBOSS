  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.esim4] Sim4 program output file

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -word               integer    [12] Sets the word size (W) for blast hits.
                                  Default value: 12. (Any integer value)
   -extend             integer    [12] Sets the word extension termination
                                  limit (X) for the blast-like stage of the
                                  algorithm. Default value: 12. (Any integer
                                  value)
   -cutoff             integer    [3] Sets the cutoff (E) in range [3,10].
                                  (Integer up to 10)
   -useramsp           toggle     [N] False: esim4 calculates mspA, True:
                                  value from mspA command line argument.
*  -amsp               integer    [16] MSP score threshold (K) for the first
                                  stage of the algorithm. (If this option is
                                  not specified, the threshold is computed
                                  from the lengths of the sequences, using
                                  statistical criteria.) For example, a good
                                  value for genomic sequences in the range of
                                  a few hundred Kb is 16. To avoid spurious
                                  matches, however, a larger value may be
                                  needed for longer sequences. (Any integer
                                  value)
   -userbmsp           toggle     [N] False: esim4 calculates mspB, True:
                                  value from mspB command line argument.
*  -bmsp               integer    [12] Sets the threshold for the MSP scores
                                  (C) when aligning the as-yet-unmatched
                                  fragments, during the second stage of the
                                  algorithm. By default, the smaller of the
                                  constant 12 and a statistics-based threshold
                                  is chosen. (Any integer value)
   -weight             integer    [0] Weight value (H) (undocumented). 0 uses
                                  a default, >0 is a value (Any integer value)
   -diagonal           integer    [10] Bound (K) for the diagonal distance
                                  within consecutive MSPs in an exon. (Any
                                  integer value)
   -strand             menu       [both] This determines the strand of the
                                  genome (R) with which the mRNA will be
                                  aligned. The default value is 'both', in
                                  which case both strands of the genome are
                                  attempted. The other allowed modes are
                                  'forward' and 'reverse'. (Values: both (Both
                                  strands); forward (Forward strand only);
                                  reverse (Reverse strand only))
   -format             integer    [0] Sets the output format (A). Exon
                                  endpoints only (format=0), exon endpoints
                                  and boundaries of the coding region (CDS) in
                                  the genomic sequence, when specified for
                                  the input mRNA (-format=5), alignment text
                                  (-format=1), alignment in lav-block format
                                  (-format=2), or both exon endpoints and
                                  alignment text (-format=3 or -format=4). If
                                  a reverse complement match is found,
                                  -format=0,1,2,3,5 will give its position in
                                  the plus strand of the longer sequence and
                                  the minus strand of the shorter sequence.
                                  -format=4 will give its position in the plus
                                  strand of the first sequence (mRNA) and the
                                  minus strand of the second sequence
                                  (genome), regardless of which sequence is
                                  longer. The -format=5 option can be used
                                  with the S command line option to specify
                                  the endpoints of the CDS in the mRNA, and
                                  produces output in the exons file format
                                  required by PipMaker. (Integer from 0 to 5)
   -cliptails          boolean    [N] Trim poly-A tails (P). Specifies whether
                                  or not the program should report the
                                  fragment of the alignment containing the
                                  poly-A tail (if found). By default
                                  (-nocliptails) the alignment is displayed as
                                  computed. When this feature is enabled
                                  (-cliptails), sim4 will remove the poly-A
                                  tails and all format options will produce
                                  additional lav alignment headers.
   -smallexons         boolean    [N] Requests an additional search for small
                                  marginal exons (N) (N=1) guided by the
                                  splice-site recognition signals. This option
                                  can be used when a high accuracy match is
                                  expected. The default value is N=0,
                                  specifying no additional search.
   -[no]ambiguity      boolean    [Y] Controls the set of characters allowed
                                  in the input sequences (B). By default
                                  (-ambiguity), ambiguity characters
                                  (ABCDGHKMNRSTVWXY) are allowed. By
                                  specifying -noambiguity, the set of
                                  acceptable characters is restricted to
                                  A,C,G,T,N and X only.
   -cdsregion          string     Allows the user to specify the endpoints of
                                  the CDS in the input mRNA (S), with the
                                  syntax: -cdsregion=n1..n2. This option is
                                  only available with the -format=5 flag,
                                  which produces output in the format required
                                  by PipMaker. Alternatively, the CDS
                                  coordinates could appear in a construct
                                  CDS=n1..n2 in the FastA header of the mRNA
                                  sequence. When the second file is an mRNA
                                  database, the command line specification for
                                  the CDS will apply to the first sequence in
                                  the file only. (Any string is accepted)
   -aoffset            integer    [0] Undocumented (f) - some sort of offset
                                  in first sequence. (Any integer value)
   -boffset            integer    [0] Undocumented (F) - some sort of offset
                                  in second sequence. (Any integer value)
   -toa                integer    [0] Undocumented (t)- offset end of first
                                  sequence? (Any integer value)
   -tob                integer    [0] Undocumented (T) - offset end of second
                                  sequence? (Any integer value)
