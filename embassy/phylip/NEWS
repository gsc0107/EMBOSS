	PHYLIP has now been embossified. All the programs now use the
emboss command line code to get the options. If the programs before
accepted sequences then these now use the emboss sequence reading code
and hence can read many most format types.
	All interactive programs have not been done as no advantage is
gained from doing this. All programs have been tested to give the same
results as those given by there respective test input/output files
given in the phylip documentation which can be founds in the doc directory.
       Some warnings are given on compilation but these have been left
as the code was changed as little as possible to make subsequent new 
versions of phylip more easily embossified.
