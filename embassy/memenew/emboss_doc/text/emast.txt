Function

   Motif detection

Description

   EMBASSY MEME is a suite of application wrappers to the original meme
   v3.0.14 applications written by Timothy Bailey. meme v3.0.14 must be
   installed on the same system as EMBOSS and the location of the meme
   executables must be defined in your path for EMBASSY MEME to work.

   Usage:
   ememe [options] mfile outfile

   The outfile parameter is new to EMBASSY MEME. The output is always
   written to .

   MAST: Motif Alignment and Search Tool

   MAST is a tool for searching biological sequence databases for
   sequences that contain one or more of a group of known motifs.

   A motif is a sequence pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group of
   related protein or DNA sequences. Motifs are represented as
   position-dependent scoring matrices that describe the score of each
   possible letter at each position in the pattern. Individual motifs may
   not contain gaps. Patterns with variable-length gaps must be split
   into two or more separate motifs before being submitted as input to
   MAST.

   MAST takes as input a file containing the descriptions of one or more
   motifs and searches a sequence database that you select for sequences
   that match the motifs. The motif file can be the output of the MEME
   motif discovery tool or any file in the appropriate format.

   MAST outputs three things:
     * 1. The names of the high-scoring sequences sorted by the strength
       of the combined match of the sequence to all of the motifs in the
       group.
     * 2. Motif diagrams showing the order and spacing of the motifs
       within each matching sequence.
     * 3. Detailed annotation of each matching sequence showing the
       sequence and the locations and strengths of matches to the motifs.

   MAST works by calculating match scores for each sequence in the
   database compared with each of the motifs in the group of motifs you
   provide. For each sequence, the match scores are converted into
   various types of p-values and these are used to determine the overall
   match of the sequence to the group of motifs and the probable order
   and spacing of occurrences of the motifs in the sequence.

  EXAMPLES:

   Please note the examples below are unedited excerpts of the original
   MEME documentation. Bear in mind the EMBASSY and original MEME options
   may differ in practice (see "1. Command-line arguments").

   The following examples assume that file "meme.results" is the output
   of a MEME run containing at least 3 motifs and file SwissProt is a
   copy of the Swiss-Prot database on your local disk. DNA_DB is a copy
   of a DNA database on your local disk.

   1) Annotate the training set:
   mast meme.results

   2) Find sequences matching the motif and annotate them in the
   SwissProt database:
   mast meme.results -d SwissProt

   3) Show sequences with weaker combined matches to motifs.
   mast meme.results -d SwissProt -ev 200

   4) Indicate weaker matches to single motifs in the annotation so that
   sequences with weak matches to the motifs (but perhaps with the
   "correct" order and spacing) can be seen:
   mast meme.results -d SwissProt -w

   5) Include a nominal order and spacing of the first three motifs in
   the calculation of the sequence p-values to increase the sensitivity
   of the search for matching sequences:
   mast meme.results -d SwissProt -diag "9-[2]-61-[1]-62-[3]-91"

   6) Use only the first and third motifs in the search:
   mast meme.results -d SwissProt -m 1 -m 3

   7) Use only the first two motifs in the search:
   mast meme.results -d SwissProt -c 2

   8) Search DNA sequences using protein motifs, adjusting p-values and
   E-values for each sequence by that sequence's composition:
   mast meme.results -d DNA_DB -dna -comp

Command line arguments

   Where possible, the same command-line qualifier names and parameter
   order is used as in the original mast. There are however several
   unavoidable differences and these are clearly documented in the
   "Notes" section below.

   Most of the options in the original mast are given in ACD as
   "advanced" or "additional" options. -options must be specified on the
   command-line in order to be prompted for a value for "additional"
   options but "advanced" options will never be prompted for.

   Please note that one only of -stdin or -d should be specified. If you
   set both, then -d will be used. This behaviour could have been
   enforced at the level of the ACD file by using an ACD select: or list:
   type but this would have been inconsistent with the original meme,
   which has two separate options.

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-mfile]             infile     If -d  is not given, MAST looks
                                  for database specified inside of .
   -ev                 float      [10] Print results for sequences with
                                  E-value (Any numeric value)
   -mt                 float      [0.0001] Show motif matches with p-value <
                                  mt (Any numeric value)
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.emast] MAST program output file

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -d                  infile     If -d  is not given, MAST looks
                                  for database specified inside of .
   -a                  infile     Input file  is assumed to contain
                                  motifs in the format output by
                                  bin/make_logodds and  is their alphabet;
                                  -d  or -stdin must be specified
                                  when this option is used.
   -bfile              infile     The random model uses the letter frequencies
                                  given in  instead of the
                                  non-redundant database frequencies. The
                                  format of  is the same as that for
                                  the MEME -bfile opton; see the MEME
                                  documentation for details. Sample files are
                                  given in directory tests: tests/nt.freq and
                                  tests/na.freq in the MEME distribution.)
   -smax               integer    [-1] Print results for no more than
                                  sequences (Any integer value)
   -stdin              boolean    [N] The default is to read the database
                                  specified inside .
   -text               boolean    [N] Default is hypertext (HTML) format
   -dna                boolean    [N] Translate DNA sequences to protein
   -comp               boolean    [N] The random model uses the letter
                                  frequencies in the current target sequence
                                  instead of the non-redundant database
                                  frequencies. This causes p-values and
                                  E-values to be compensated individually for
                                  the actual composition of each sequence in
                                  the database. This option can increase
                                  search time substantially due to the need to
                                  compute a different score distribution for
                                  each high-scoring sequence.
   -rank               integer    [-1] Print results starting with  best
                                  (Any integer value)

   -remcorr            boolean    [N] Remove highly correlated motifs from
                                  query

                                  documentation.
   -b                  boolean    [N] Print only sections I and II
   -nostatus           boolean    [N] Do not print progress report
   -hitlist            boolean    [N] If you specify the -hitlist switch to
                                  MAST, the motif 'diagram' takes the form of
                                  a comma separated list of motif occurrences
                                  ('hits'). Each 'hit' has the format:

                                  where  is the strand (+ or - for
                                  DNA, blank for protein),  is the
                                  motif number,  is the starting
                                  position of the hit,  is the ending
                                  position of the hit, and  is the
                                  position p-value of the hit.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -c                  integer    [-1] Only use the first  motifs (Any
                                  integer value)
   -sep                boolean    [N] Score reverse complement DNA strand as a
                                  separate sequence
   -norc               boolean    [N] Do not score reverse complement DNA

   -w                  boolean    [N] Show weak matches (mt as motif file name.
