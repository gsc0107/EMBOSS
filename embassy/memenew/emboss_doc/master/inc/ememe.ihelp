   -mod                selection  [zoops] If you know how occurrences of
                                  motifs are distributed in the training set
                                  sequences, you can specify it with these
                                  options. The default distribution of motif
                                  occurrences is assumed to be zero or one
                                  occurrence of per sequence. oops : One
                                  Occurrence Per Sequence. MEME assumes that
                                  each sequence in the dataset contains
                                  exactly one occurrence of each motif. This
                                  option is the fastest and most sensitive but
                                  the motifs returned by MEME may be 'blurry'
                                  if any of the sequences is missing them.
                                  zoops : Zero or One Occurrence Per Sequence.
                                  MEME assumes that each sequence may contain
                                  at most one occurrence of each motif. This
                                  option is useful when you suspect that some
                                  motifs may be missing from some of the
                                  sequences. In that case, the motifs found
                                  will be more accurate than using the first
                                  option. This option takes more computer time
                                  than the first option (about twice as much)
                                  and is slightly less sensitive to weak

                                  : Any Number of Repetitions. MEME assumes
                                  each sequence may contain any number of
                                  non-overlapping occurrences of each motif.
                                  This option is useful when you suspect that
                                  motifs repeat multiple times within a single
                                  sequence. In that case, the motifs found
                                  will be much more accurate than using one of
                                  the other options. This option can also be
                                  used to discover repeats within a single
                                  sequence. This option takes the much more
                                  computer time than the first option (about
                                  ten times as much) and is somewhat less
                                  sensitive to weak motifs which do not repeat
                                  within a single sequence than the other two
                                  options.

                                  low variance dmix; variance is scaled
                                  inversely with the size of the dataset.

                                  documentation for further information. (Any
                                  integer value)
   -noendgaps          boolean    [N] The -nomatrim, -wg, -ws and -noendgaps
                                  switches control trimming (shortening) of
                                  motifs using the multiple alignment method.
                                  Specifying -nomatrim causes MEME to skip
                                  this and causes the other switches to be
                                  ignored. The pairwise alignment is
                                  controlled by the switches -wg (gap cost),
                                  -ws (space cost) and -noendgaps (do not
                                  penalize endgaps). See application
                                  documentation for further information.
   -revcomp            boolean    [N] Motifs occurrences may be on the given
                                  DNA strand or on its reverse complement. The
                                  default is to look for DNA motifs only on
                                  the strand given in the training set.
   -pal                boolean    [N] Choosing -pal causes MEME to look for
                                  palindromes in DNA datasets. MEME averages
                                  the letter frequencies in corresponding
                                  columns of the motif (PSPM) together. For
                                  instance, if the width of the motif is 10,
                                  columns 1 and 10, 2 and 9, 3 and 8, etc.,
                                  are averaged together. The averaging
                                  combines the frequency of A in one column
                                  with T in the other, and the frequency of C
                                  in one column with G in the other.
   -[no]nostatus       boolean    [Y] Set this option to print a progress
                                  report to the terminal.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -maxiter            integer    [50] The number of iterations of EM to run
                                  from any starting point. EM is run for <n>
                                  iterations or until convergence (see
                                  -distance, below) from each starting point.
                                  (Any integer value)
   -distance           float      [0.001] The convergence criterion. MEME
                                  stops iterating EM when the change in the
                                  motif frequency matrix is less than <a>.
                                  (Change is the euclidean distance between
                                  two successive frequency matrices.) (Any
                                  numeric value)
   -b                  float      [-1.0] The strength of the prior on model
                                  parameters. A value of 0 means use intrinsic
                                  strength of prior if prior = dmix. The
                                  default values are 0.01 if prior = dirichlet
                                  or 0 if prior = dmix. These defaults are
                                  hardcoded into MEME (the value of the
                                  default in the ACD file is not used). (Any
                                  numeric value)
   -spfuzz             float      [-1.0] The fuzziness of the mapping.
                                  Possible values are greater than 0. Meaning
                                  depends on -spmap, see below. See the
                                  application documentation for more
                                  information. (Any numeric value)
   -spmap              selection  [uni] The type of mapping function to use.
                                  uni: Use prior when converting a substring
                                  to an estimate of theta. Default -spfuzz
                                  <a>: 0.5. pam: Use columns of PAM <a> matrix
                                  when converting a substring to an estimate
                                  of theta. Default -spfuzz <a>: 120 (PAM
                                  120). See the application documentation for

                                  <string>. This is useful when an actual
                                  occurrence of a motif is known and can be
                                  used as the starting point for finding the
                                  motif. See the application documentation for
                                  more information. (Any string is accepted)

                                  -p <np> argument causes a version of MEME
                                  compiled for a parallel CPU architecture to
                                  be run. (By placing <np> in quotes you may
                                  pass installation specific switches to the
                                  'mpirun' command. The number of processors
                                  to run on must be the first argument
                                  following -p). (Any integer value)
   -time               integer    [0] Only values of more than 0 will be
