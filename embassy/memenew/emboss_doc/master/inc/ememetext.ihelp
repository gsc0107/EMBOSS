   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-dataset]           seqset     User must provide the full filename of a set
                                  of sequences, not an indirect reference,
                                  e.g. a USA is NOT acceptable.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -bfile              infile     The name of the file containing the
                                  background model for sequences. The
                                  background model is the model of random
                                  sequences used by MEME. The background model
                                  is used by MEME 1) during EM as the 'null
                                  model', 2) for calculating the log
                                  likelihood ratio of a motif, 3) for
                                  calculating the significance (E-value) of a
                                  motif, and, 4) for creating the
                                  position-specific scoring matrix (log-odds
                                  matrix). See application documentation for
                                  more information.
   -plibfile           infile     The name of the file containing the
                                  Dirichlet prior in the format of file
                                  prior30.plib
   -mod                selection  [zoops] If you know how occurrences of
                                  motifs are distributed in the training set
                                  sequences, you can specify it with these
                                  options. The default distribution of motif
                                  occurrences is assumed to be zero or one
                                  occurrence per sequence. oops : One
                                  Occurrence Per Sequence. MEME assumes that
                                  each sequence in the dataset contains
                                  exactly one occurrence of each motif. This
                                  option is the fastest and most sensitive but
                                  the motifs returned by MEME may be 'blurry'
                                  if any of the sequences is missing them.
                                  zoops : Zero or One Occurrence Per Sequence.
                                  MEME assumes that each sequence may contain
                                  at most one occurrence of each motif. This
                                  option is useful when you suspect that some
                                  motifs may be missing from some of the
                                  sequences. In that case, the motifs found
                                  will be more accurate than using the first
                                  option. This option takes more computer time
                                  than the first option (about twice as much)
                                  and is slightly less sensitive to weak
                                  motifs present in all of the sequences. anr
                                  : Any Number of Repetitions. MEME assumes
                                  each sequence may contain any number of
                                  non-overlapping occurrences of each motif.
                                  This option is useful when you suspect that
                                  motifs repeat multiple times within a single
                                  sequence. In that case, the motifs found
                                  will be much more accurate than using one of
                                  the other options. This option can also be
                                  used to discover repeats within a single
                                  sequence. This option takes the much more
                                  computer time than the first option (about
                                  ten times as much) and is somewhat less
                                  sensitive to weak motifs which do not repeat
                                  within a single sequence than the other two
                                  options.
   -nmotifs            integer    [1] The number of *different* motifs to
                                  search for. MEME will search for and output
                                  <n> motifs. (Any integer value)
   -text               boolean    [N] Default output is in HTML
   -prior              selection  [dirichlet] The prior distribution on the
                                  model parameters. dirichlet: Simple
                                  Dirichlet prior. This is the default for
                                  -dna and -alph. It is based on the
                                  non-redundant database letter frequencies.
                                  dmix: Mixture of Dirichlets prior. This is
                                  the default for -protein. mega: Extremely
                                  low variance dmix; variance is scaled
                                  inversely with the size of the dataset.
                                  megap: Mega for all but last iteration of
                                  EM; dmix on last iteration. addone: Add +1
                                  to each observed count.
   -evt                float      [-1] Quit looking for motifs if E-value
                                  exceeds this value. Has an extremely high
                                  default so by default MEME never quits
                                  before -nmotifs <n> have been found. A value
                                  of -1 here is a shorthand for infinity.

                                  number in the range [0..1). The larger it
                                  is, the stronger the bias towards motifs
                                  with exactly nsites occurrences is. (Any

                                  motifs using the multiple alignment method.
                                  Specifying -nomatrim causes MEME to skip

                                  Specifying -nomatrim causes MEME to skip
                                  this and causes the other switches to be
                                  ignored. The pairwise alignment is

   -revcomp            boolean    [N] Motif occurrences may be on the given
                                  DNA strand or on its reverse complement. The
                                  default is to look for DNA motifs only on
                                  the strand given in the training set.
   -pal                boolean    [N] Choosing -pal causes MEME to look for
                                  palindromes in DNA datasets. MEME averages
                                  the letter frequencies in corresponding
                                  columns of the motif (PSPM) together. For
                                  instance, if the width of the motif is 10,
                                  columns 1 and 10, 2 and 9, 3 and 8, etc.,
                                  are averaged together. The averaging
                                  combines the frequency of A in one column
                                  with T in the other, and the frequency of C
                                  in one column with G in the other.

                                  from any starting point. EM is run for <n>
                                  iterations or until convergence (see
                                  -distance, below) from each starting point.

   -distance           float      [0.001] The convergence criterion. MEME
                                  stops iterating EM when the change in the
                                  motif frequency matrix is less than <a>.
                                  (Change is the euclidean distance between
                                  two successive frequency matrices.) (Any

                                  parameters. A value of 0 means use intrinsic
                                  strength of prior if prior = dmix. The
                                  default values are 0.01 if prior = dirichlet
                                  or 0 if prior = dmix. These defaults are
                                  hardcoded into MEME (the value of the
                                  default in the ACD file is not used). A
                                  value of -1 here represents -b being
                                  unspecified. (Any numeric value)

                                  information. A value of -1.0 here represents
                                  -spfuzz being unspecified. (Any numeric
                                  value)

                                  <string>. This is useful when an actual
                                  occurrence of a motif is known and can be
                                  used as the starting point for finding the
