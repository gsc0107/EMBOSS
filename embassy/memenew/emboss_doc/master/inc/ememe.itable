<tr>
<td>-bfile</td>
<td>The name of the file containing the background model for sequences. The background model is the model of random sequences used by MEME. The background model is used by MEME 1) during EM as the 'null model', 2) for calculating the log likelihood ratio of a motif, 3) for calculating the significance (E-value) of a motif, and, 4) for creating the position-specific scoring matrix (log-odds matrix). See application documentation for more information.</td>

<tr>
<td>-mod</td>
<td>If you know how occurrences of motifs are distributed in the training set sequences, you can specify it with these options. The default distribution of motif occurrences is assumed to be zero or one occurrence per sequence. oops : One Occurrence Per Sequence. MEME assumes that each sequence in the dataset contains exactly one occurrence of each motif. This option is the fastest and most sensitive but the motifs returned by MEME may be 'blurry' if any of the sequences is missing them. zoops : Zero or One Occurrence Per Sequence. MEME assumes that each sequence may contain at most one occurrence of each motif. This option is useful when you suspect that some motifs may be missing from some of the sequences. In that case, the motifs found will be more accurate than using the first option. This option takes more computer time than the first option (about twice as much) and is slightly less sensitive to weak motifs present in all of the sequences. anr : Any Number of Repetitions. MEME assumes each sequence may contain any number of non-overlapping occurrences of each motif. This option is useful when you suspect that motifs repeat multiple times within a single sequence. In that case, the motifs found will be much more accurate than using one of the other options. This option can also be used to discover repeats within a single sequence. This option takes the much more computer time than the first option (about ten times as much) and is somewhat less sensitive to weak motifs which do not repeat within a single sequence than the other two options.</td>
