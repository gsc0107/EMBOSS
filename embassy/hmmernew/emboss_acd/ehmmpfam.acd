The default is negative infinity; by default, all domains in the sequences that passed the frst threshold will be reported in the second list, so that the number of domains reported in the per-sequence list is consistent with the number that appear in the per-domain list. Important note: only one domain in a sequence is absolutely controlled by this parameter, or by --domT. The second and subsequent domains in a sequence have a de facto bit score threshold of 0 because of the details of how HMMER works. HMMER requires at least one pass through the main model per sequence; to do more than one pass (more than one domain) the multidomain alignment must have a better score than the single domain alignment, and hence the extra domains must contribute positive score. See the Users' Guide for more detail."

boolean: forward  
[
  default: "N"
  information: "Use forward algorithm"
  help: "Use the Forward algorithm instead of the Viterbi algorithm to determine the per-sequence scores. Per-domain scores are still determined by the Viterbi algorithm. Some have argued that Forward is a more sensitive algorithm for detecting remote sequence homologues; my experiments with HMMER have not confrmed this, however."

boolean: nulltwo  
[
  default: "N"
  information: "Turn off second null model"
  help: "Turn off the post hoc second null model. By default, each alignment is rescored by a postprocessing step that takes into account possible biased composition in either the HMM or the target sequence. This is almost essential in database searches, especially with local alignment models. There is a very small chance that this postprocessing might remove real matches, and in these cases --null2 may improve sensitivity at the expense of reducing specifcity by letting biased composition hits through."

boolean: pvm  
[
  default: "N"
  information: "Use parallel virtual machine"
  help: "Run on a Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM). The PVM must already be running. The client program hmmpfam-pvm must be installed on all the PVM nodes. The HMM database hmmfile and an associated GSI index file hmmfile.gsi must also be installed on all the PVM nodes. (The GSI index is produced by the program hmmindex.) Because the PVM implementation is I/O bound, it is highly recommended that each node have a local copy of hmmfile rather than NFS mounting a shared copy. Optional PVM support must have been compiled into HMMER for -pvm to function."
