   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-hmmfilein]         infile     File containing an HMM.
  [-hmmfileout]        outfile    [*.ehmmcalibrate] File containing an HMM
                                  with EVD parameters.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -cpu                integer    [0] Sets the maximum number of CPUs that the
                                  program will run on. The default is to use
                                  all CPUs in the machine. Overrides the HMMER
                                  NCPU environment variable. Only affects
                                  threaded versions of HMMER (the default on
                                  most systems). (Integer 0 or more)
   -fixed              integer    [0] Fix the length of the random sequences
                                  to <n>, where <n> is a positive (and
                                  reasonably sized) integer. The default is
                                  instead to generate sequences with a variety
                                  of different lengths, controlled by a
                                  Gaussian (normal) distribution. (Integer 0
                                  or more)
   -mean               float      [350.0] Set the mean length of the synthetic
                                  sequences to <x>, where <x> is a positive
                                  real number. The default is 350. (Any
                                  numeric value)
   -num                integer    [5000] Set the number of synthetic sequences
                                  to <n>, where <n> is a positive integer. If
                                  <n> is less than about 1000, the ft to the
                                  EVD may fail. Higher numbers of <n> will
                                  give better determined EVD parameters. The
                                  default is 5000; it was empirically chosen
                                  as a tradeoff between accuracy and
                                  computation time. (Integer 0 or more)
   -pvm                boolean    [N] Run on a Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM).
                                  The PVM must already be running. The client
                                  program hmmcalibrate-pvm must be installed
                                  on all the PVM nodes. Optional PVM support
                                  must have been compiled into HMMER.
   -sd                 float      [350.0] Set the standard deviation of the
                                  synthetic sequence length distribution to
                                  <x>, where <x> is a positive real number.
                                  The default is 350. Note that the Gaussian
                                  is left-truncated so that no sequences have
                                  lengths <= 0. (Number 0.000 or more)
   -seed               integer    [0] Set the random seed to <n>, where <n> is
                                  a positive integer. The default is to use
                                  time() to generate a different seed for each
                                  run, which means that two different runs of
                                  hmmcalibrate on the same HMM will give
                                  slightly different results. You can use this
                                  option to generate reproducible results for
                                  different hmmcalibrate runs on the same
                                  HMM. (Integer 0 or more)
   -histfile           outfile    [*.ehmmcalibrate] Save a histogram of the
                                  scores and the fitted theoretical curve to
                                  file.
