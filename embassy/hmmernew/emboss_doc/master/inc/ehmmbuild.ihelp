   -prior              infile     Read a Dirichlet prior from file, replacing
                                  the default mixture Dirichlet. The format of
                                  prior files is documented in the User's
                                  Guide, and an example is given in the Demos
                                  directory of the HMMER distribution.
   -null               infile     Read a null model from file. The default for
                                  protein is to use average amino acid
                                  frequencies from Swissprot 34 and p1 =
                                  350/351; for nucleic acid, the default is to
                                  use 0.25 for each base and p1 = 1000/1001.
                                  For documentation of the format of the null
                                  model file and further explanation of how
                                  the null model is used, see the User's
                                  Guide.
   -pam                infile     Apply a heuristic PAM- (substitution
                                  matrix-) based prior on match emission
                                  probabilities instead of the default mixture
                                  Dirichlet. The substitution matrix is read
                                  from file. See -pamwgt. The default
                                  Dirichlet state transition prior and insert
                                  emission prior are unaffected. Therefore in
                                  principle you could combine -prior with -pam
                                  but this isn't recommended, as it hasn't
                                  been tested. ( -pam itself hasn't been
                                  tested much!)
   -pamwgt             float      [20.0] Controls the weight <x> on a
                                  PAM-based prior. Only has effect if -pam
                                  option is also in use. <x> is a positive
                                  real number, 20.0 by default. <x> is the
                                  number of 'pseudocounts' contriubuted by the
                                  heuristic prior. Very high values of <x>
                                  can force a scoring system that is entirely
                                  driven by the substitution matrix, making
                                  HMMER somewhat approximate Gribskov
                                  profiles. (Any numeric value)
   -pbswitch           integer    [1000] For alignments with a very large
                                  number of sequences, the GSC, BLOSUM, and
                                  Voronoi weighting schemes are slow; they're
                                  O(N^2) for N sequences. Henikoff
                                  position-based weights (PB weights) are more
                                  effcient. At or above a certain threshold
                                  sequence number <n> hmmbuild will switch
                                  from GSC, BLOSUM, or Voronoi weights to PB
                                  weights. To disable this switching behavior
                                  (at the cost of compute time, set <n> to be
                                  something larger than the number of
                                  sequences in your alignment. <n> is a
                                  positive integer; the default is 1000. (Any
                                  integer value)
   -archpri            float      [0.85] The value of the 'architecture prior'
                                  used by MAP architecture construction. This
                                  value is a probability between 0 and 1.
                                  This parameter governs a geometric prior
                                  distribution over model lengths. As
                                  'archpri' increases, longer models are
                                  favored a priori. As 'archpri' decreases, it
                                  takes more residue conservation in a column
                                  to make a column a 'consensus' match column
                                  in the model architecture. The 0.85 default
                                  has been chosen empirically as a reasonable
                                  setting. (Any numeric value)
   -binary             boolean    [N] Write the HMM to file in HMMER binary
                                  format instead of readable ASCII text.
   -fast               boolean    [N] Quickly and heuristically determine the
                                  architecture of the model by assigning all
                                  columns with more than a certain fraction of
                                  gap characters to insert states. By default
                                  this fraction is 0.5, and it can be changed
                                  using the --gapmax option. The default
                                  construction algorithm is a maximum a
                                  posteriori (MAP) algorithm, which is slower.
   -gapmax             float      [0.5] Controls the -fast model construction
                                  algorithm, but if -fast is not being used,
                                  has no effect. If a column has more than a
                                  fraction <x> of gap symbols in it, it gets
                                  assigned to an insert column. <x> is a
                                  frequency from 0 to 1, and by default is set
                                  to 0.5. Higher values of <x> mean more
                                  columns get assigned to consensus, and
                                  models get longer; smaller values of <x>
                                  mean fewer columns get assigned to
                                  consensus, and models get smaller. (Any
                                  numeric value)
   -hand               boolean    [N] Specify the architecture of the model by
                                  hand: the alignment file must be in SELEX
                                  or Stockholm format, and the reference
                                  annotation line (RF in SELEX, GC RF in
                                  Stockholm) is used to specify the
                                  architecture. Any column marked with a
                                  non-gap symbol (such as an 'x', for
                                  instance) is assigned as a consensus (match)
                                  column in the model.
   -sidlevel           float      [0.62] Controls both the determination of
                                  effective sequence number and the behavior
                                  of the -wblosum weighting option. The
                                  sequence alignment is clustered by percent
                                  identity, and the number of clusters at a
                                  cutoff threshold of <x> is used to determine
                                  the effective sequence number. Higher
                                  values of <x> give more clusters and higher
                                  effective sequence numbers; lower values of
                                  <x> give fewer clusters and lower effective
                                  sequence numbers. <x> is a fraction from 0
                                  to 1, and by default is set to 0.62
                                  (corresponding to the clustering level used
                                  in constructing the BLOSUM62 substitution
                                  matrix). (Any numeric value)
   -noeff              boolean    [N] Turn off the effective sequence number
                                  calculation, and use the true number of
                                  sequences instead. This will usually reduce
                                  the sensitivity of the final model (so don't
                                  do it without good reason!)
   -swentry            float      [0.5] Controls the total probability that is
                                  distributed to local entries into the
                                  model, versus starting at the beginning of
                                  the model as in a global alignment. <x> is a
                                  probability from 0 to 1, and by default is
                                  set to 0.5. Higher values of <x> mean that
                                  hits that are fragments on their left (N or
                                  5'-terminal) side will be penalized less,
                                  but complete global alignments will be
                                  penalized more. Lower values of <x> mean
                                  that fragments on the left will be penalized
                                  more, and global alignments on this side
                                  will be favored. This option only affects
                                  the confgurations that allow local
                                  alignments, e.g. -s and -f; unless one of
                                  these options is also activated, this option
                                  has no effect. You have independent control
                                  over local/global alignment behavior for
                                  the N/C (5'/3') termini of your target

   -swexit             float      [0.5] Controls the total probability that is

                                  versus ending an alignment at the end of the
                                  model as in a global alignment. <x> is a
                                  probability from 0 to 1, and by default is
                                  set to 0.5. Higher values of <x> mean that

                                  in the alignment.
   -weighting          menu       [G] Values (B)(-wblosum in HMMER) Use the
                                  BLOSUM filtering algorithm to weight the
                                  sequences. Cluster the sequences at a given
                                  percentage identity (see -idlevel); assign
                                  each cluster a total weight of 1.0,
                                  distributed equally amongst the members of
                                  that cluster. (G)(-wgsc in HMMER) Use the
                                  Gerstein/Sonnhammer/Chothia ad hoc sequence
                                  weighting algorithm. This is the default.
                                  (K)(-wme in HMMER) Use the Krogh/Mitchison
                                  maximum entropy algorithm to 'weight' the
                                  sequences. This supercedes the
                                  Eddy/Mitchison/Durbin maximum discrimination
                                  algorithm, which gives almost identical
                                  weights but is less robust. ME weighting
                                  seems to give a marginal increase in
                                  sensitivity over the default GSC weights,
                                  but takes a fair amount of time. (W) (-wpb
                                  in HMMER) Use the Henikoff position-based
                                  weighting scheme. (V) (-wvoronoi in HMMER)
                                  Use the Sibbald/Argos Voronoi sequence
                                  weighting algorithm in place of the default
                                  GSC weighting. (N) (-wnone in HMMER) Turn
                                  off all sequence weighting. (Values: B
                                  (Blosum); G (Gerstein/Sonnhammer/Chothia); K
                                  (Krogh/Mitchison); W (Henikoff); V
                                  (Sibbald/Argos Voronoi); N (None))
   -o                  outfile    Re-save the starting alignment to file, in
                                  Stockholm format. The columns which were
                                  assigned to match states will be marked with
                                  x's in an RF annotation line. If either the
                                  -hand or -fast construction options were
                                  chosen, the alignment may have been slightly
                                  altered to be compatible with Plan 7
                                  transitions, so saving the final alignment
                                  and comparing to the starting alignment can
                                  let you view these alterations. See the
                                  User's Guide for more information on this
                                  arcane side effect.
   -cfile              outfile    Save the observed emission and transition
                                  counts to file after the architecture has
                                  been determined (e.g. after residues/gaps
                                  have been assigned to match, delete, and
                                  insert states). This option is used in HMMER
                                  development for generating data files
                                  useful for training new Dirichlet priors.
                                  The format of count files is documented in
                                  the User's Guide.
