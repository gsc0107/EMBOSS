   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-hmmfile]           infile     File containing a HMM profile
  [-seqfile]           seqset     File containing a (set of) sequence(s)
  [-o]                 align      Multiple sequence alignment output file.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -m                  boolean    Include in the alignment only those symbols
                                  aligned to match states. Do not show symbols
                                  assigned to insert states.
   -q                  boolean    Quiet; suppress all output except the
                                  alignment itself. Useful for piping or
                                  redirecting the output.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -mapali             infile     Reads an alignment from file and aligns it
                                  as a single object to the HMM; e.g. the
                                  alignment in file is held fixed. This allows
                                  you to align sequences to a model with
                                  hmmalign and view them in the context of an
                                  existing trusted multiple alignment. The
                                  alignment to the alignment is defined by a
                                  'map' kept in the HMM, and so is fast and
                                  guaranteed to be consistent with the way the
                                  HMM was constructed from the alignment. The
                                  alignment in the file must be exactly the
                                  alignment that the HMM was built from.
                                  Compare the -withali option.
   -withali            infile     Reads an alignment from file and aligns it
                                  as a single object to the HMM; e.g. the
                                  alignment in file is held fixed. This allows
                                  you to align sequences to a model with
                                  hmmalign and view them in the context of an
                                  existing trusted multiple alignment. The
                                  alignment to the alignment is done with a
                                  heuristic (nonoptimal) dynamic programming
                                  procedure, which may be somewhat slow and is
                                  not guaranteed to be completely consistent
                                  with the way the HMM was constructed (though
                                  it should be quite close). However, any
                                  alignment can be used, not just the
                                  alignment that the HMM was built from.
                                  Compare the -mapali option.
