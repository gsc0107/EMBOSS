        Long description.

        When it should/shouldn't be used.
  -->
EMBASSY HMMER is a suite of application wrappers to the original hmmer v2.3.2 applications written by Sean Eddy. hmmer v2.3.2 must be installed on the same system as EMBOSS and the location of the hmmer executables must be defined in your path for EMBASSY HMMER to work.

<p><b>Usage:</b>
<br>hmmsearch [options] hmmfile seqfile outfile
<p>The outfile parameter is new to EMBASSY HMMER.

<p>hmmsearch reads an HMM from <hmmfile> and searches <seqfile> for signifcantly similar sequence matches.  seqfile will be looked for first in the current working directory, then in a directory named by the environment variable BLASTDB. This lets users use existing BLAST databases, if BLAST has been confgured for the site. hmmsearch may take minutes or even hours to run, depending on the size of the sequence database. The output is written to a file called <outfile>.  The output consists of four sections: a ranked list of the best scoring sequences, a ranked list of the best scoring domains, alignments for all the best scoring domains, and a histogram of the scores. A sequencescore may be higher than a domain score for the same sequence if there is more than one domain in the sequence; the sequence score takes into account all the domains. All sequences scoring above the -E and -T cutoffs are shown in the frst list, then every domain found in this list is shown in the second list of domain hits. If desired, E-value and bit score thresholds may also be applied to the domain list using the -domE and -domT options.

    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->

<!--#include file="inc/ehmmsearch.usage" -->



<H2>
    Command line arguments
</H2>
Where possible, the same command-line qualifier names and parameter order is used as in the original hmmer.  There are however several unavoidable differences and these are clearly documented in the "Notes" section below.
<p>More or less all options documented as "expert" in the original hmmer user guide are given in ACD as "advanced" options (-options must be specified on the command-line in order to be prompted for a value for them).

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>
<H3>Alignment and sequence formats </H3>
Input and output of alignments and sequences is limited to the formats that the original hmmer supports. These include stockholm, SELEX, MSF, Clustal, Phylip and A2M /aligned FASTA (alignments) and FASTA, GENBANK, EMBL, GCG, PIR (sequences).  It would be fairly straightforward to adapt the code to support all EMBOSS-supported formats. 

<H3>Compressed input files </H3>
Automatic processing of gzipped files is not supported. 
<p>


<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

<b>ehmmsearch</b> reads any normal sequence USAs.

        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)

    Notes

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->
<H3>1. Command-line arguments</H3>
The following original HMMER options are not supported:
<br><pre>
-h         : Use -help to get help information instead.
-informat  : All common sequence file formats are supported automatically.
</pre>

<p>
The following additional options are provided:
<br><pre>
-outfile   : Multiple sequence alignment output file.
</pre>



<H3>2. Installing EMBASSY HMMER</H3>
The EMBASSY HMMER package contains "wrapper" applications providing an EMBOSS-style interface to the applications in the original HMMER package version 2.3.2 developed by Sean Eddy.  Please read the file INSTALL in the EMBASSY HMMER package distribution for installation instructions.

<H3>3. Installing original HMMER</H3>
To use EMBASSY HMMER, you will first need to download and install the original HMMER package.  Please read the file 00README in the the original HMMER package distribution for installation instructions:
<pre>
WWW home:       http://hmmer.wustl.edu/
Distribution:   ftp://ftp.genetics.wustl.edu/pub/eddy/hmmer/
</pre>

<H3>4. Setting up HMMER</H3>
For the EMBASSY HMMER package to work, the directory containing the original HMMER executables *must* be in your path. For example if you executables were installed to "/usr/local/hmmer/bin", then type:
<pre>
set path=(/usr/local/hmmer/bin/ $path)
rehash
</pre>

<H3> 5. Getting help </H3>
Please read the Userguide.pdf distributed with the original HMMER and included in the EMBASSY HMMER distribution under the DOCS directory. The first 3 chapters (Introduction, Installation and Tutorial) are particularly useful.
<p>Please read the 'Notes' section below for a description of the differences between the original and EMBASSY HMMER, particularly which application command line options are supported.

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.
   -->
<H3>Types of input data</H3>
hmmer v3.2.1 and therefore EMBASSY HMMER is only recommended for use with protein sequences.  If you provide a non-protein sequence you will be reprompted for a protein sequence.  To accept nucleic acid sequences you must replace instances of < type: "protein" > in the application ACD files with <type: "nucleic" >.

<H3>Environment variables</H3>
The original hmmer uses BLAST environment variables (below), if defined, to locate files. The EMBASSY HMMER does not.
<pre>
BLASTDB   location of sequence databases to be searched
BLASMAT   location of substitution matrices
HMMERDB   location of HMMs
</pre>

<H3>Sequence input </H3>
The user must provide the full filename of a sequence database for the sequence input ("seqfile" ACD option), not an indirect reference, e.g. a USA is NOT acceptable.  This is because hmmsearch (which ehmmsearch wraps) does not support USAs, and a full sequence database is too big to write to a temporary file that the original hmmsearch would understand.
