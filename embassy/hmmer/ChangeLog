Version 0.1.0
	Modified the Malloc function to intialise all memory to
	zero. Binary files with character strings were giving errors in
	valgrind memory leak testing because bytes after the null
	character were "uninitialised". Naturally anything reading these
	files will have stopped at the null character so this will make no
	difference to the results.
