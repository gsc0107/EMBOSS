Crystalball is an application invented by Scott Markel and Darryl Leon
in their book "Sequence Analysis in a Nutshell". They put the
description into Appendix D with the comment:

<p>
<i>Here's a program we're working on. When it's finished we plan to
donate it to the EMBOSS package. It may take us a while, so be
patient</i>

<p>
It took just 30 minutes from seeing a draft of Appendix D to sending
Scott the ACD file and then the C source code.

<p>
Like Scott and Darryl, we put the program into an EMBASSY package
called "appendixd" in the hope that nobody takes it too seriously,
although we suspect the results are more accurate than one would
reasonably be entitled to expect.
