The crystalball program was defined by Scott Markel and Darryl Leon
of LION bioscience AG in Appendix D of their book "Sequence Analysis
in a Nutshell"

This section of the book is a complete definition of the ACD
interface, and a clear description of the output and the functions
intended for the ACD command line options.

In recognition of their interest in EMBOSS, and in reaction to a
sentence in the appendix that says the program does not exists,
"crystalball" was written (in about 30 minutes) by the EMBOSS team.
