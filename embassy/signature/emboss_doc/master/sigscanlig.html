SIGSCANLIG reads one more sequences, e.g. from a sequence database, and scans each in turn against a library of ligand-binding signatures (directory of signature files).  The signatures may be of type 1D or 3D.  To perform the scan, the user provides a scoring matrix which is either a residue substitution matrix (1D signatures) or matrix of 3D:1D (environment:residue) scores (3D). Various other parameters including gap insertion and extension penalties and a score mode are also set. For each query sequence, 3 files are generated as follows: (i) An LHF file (ligand hits file) of hits to the signatures. (ii) A SAF file (signature alignment file) of the corresponding signature-sequence alignments.  (iii) A results file, containing a list of hits (ligands), rank-ordered on the basis of score.  The user specifies the query sequences and also the paths of the signature files (input), LHF, SAF and results files (output).  The file extensions are specified in the ACD file.

<a name="4.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 4.0   OUTPUT FILE FORMAT         </H2>




<b>LHF file (ligand hits file)</b>
<br>Each LHF file contains the hits from the search of a single query sequence against the library of signatures.  The file (Figure 1) contains two lines per hit. The first contains a description of the hit in 17 text tokens delimited by '^'.  The second line contains the protein sequence.  The tokens are as follows (a '.' is given where a token does not have a value).

<UL>
<LI>(i) Accession number.
<LI>(ii)  Database code.
<LI>(iii - iv) Start and end positions of the hit relative to the full length sequence. 
</UL>

<br>The next 9 tokens refer to the domain family, superfamily etc for which the signature was derived and are as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>(v)  'LIGAND' is always given.
<LI>(vi)  4-character PDB identifier code. 
<LI>(vii)  7-character domain identifier code from SCOP or CATH.
<LI>(viii) Ligand identifier code.  A 3-letter abbreviation of the full ligand name.

<LI>(ix) Site number.  This uniquely identifies a ligand-binding site in the CON file generated by running SITES.
<LI>(x) The total number of binding sites for a given ligand.
<LI>(xi) Patch number.  The sequential order (from the N-terminus) of the patch in the ligand-binding site from which the signature was derived. 
<LI>(xii) Number of patches. The total number of patches in this ligand-binding site.
<LI>(xiii) Signature data type, either '1D' or '3D', for sequence or structure-based signatures respectively. 
<LI>(xiv) Signature type, either 'P' for patch signatures or 'F' for full-length signatures.
</UL>

<br>The next 3 tokens refer to the hit, specifically, information about the search result as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>(xv) Score of hit from search algoritm.
<LI>(xvi) P-value of hit (not written by SIGSCANLIG).
<LI>(xvii) E-value of hit (not written by SIGSCANLIG).
</UL>


<br><br>
<b>SAF file (signature alignment file)</b>
<br>
The format of the SAF file (signature alignment file, Figure 2) is more or less identical to DAF (domain alignment file) described in the <a href="domainalign.html">DOMAINALIGN documentation</a>.  The file conforms to EMBOSS "simple" multiple sequence alignment format.  Each file contains the signature-sequence alignments corresponding to the search of a single query sequence against a library of signatures.  The SAF file generated by SIGSCANLIG contains some unique features which are summarised here. 

<br><br>
 All lines beginning with '#' are comments and the first line is always '# DE   Alignment of query sequence against library of signatures'. Each signature-sequence alignment is contained in one or more blocks in the file. These blocks are preceeded by a comment line containing information for the corresponding hit from the LHF (above). Each block contains contains the signature identifier code and accession number of the protein sequence, sequence positions and a section of the signature-sequence alignment.

<UL>
<li>The signature identifier code uniquely identifies the signature and is of the format <I>ligand identifer code</I>_<I>site number</I>_<I>patch number</I>.  The ligand identifier, site number and the patch number are defined above (a '0' will be given for patch number if the site was represented as a single 'full-length' signature rather than patches).

<LI>The sequence positions are the start and end residue positions of the appropriate section of sequence. The character '-' is used for gaps.  

<LI> The protein sequence is given after the accession number and the signature-sequence alignment is given as a markup line underneath the sequence (signature positions are marked with a '*').
</UL>


<br><br>
<b>Results file</b>
<BR>Each results file (Figure 3) contains the summarised results of the search of a single query sequence against the library of signatures.  The results file contains a list of ligands, rank-ordered on the basis of score (highest-scoring ligand is given first). There are four columns under the labels 'LIGID, 'PATCHES', 'SITES' and 'SCORE'.  These give the ligand identifier, the number of patches for that ligand binding site, the number of sites for the ligand and the score of the sequence-signature match.  In the example shown (Figure 3) there is a single ligand.  Typically, the library would represent all ligands represented in PDB.

<!-- DESCRIPTION
     A complete, non-technical, user-level description of the application.
-->
<a name="9.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 9.0   DESCRIPTION               </H2>

SIGSCANLIG is an application to screen a query protein sequence against a library of signatures for ligand-binding. 
See Blades et al., Ison et al. and Daniel et al. for a description of other types of protein signatures and their application.




<!-- ALGORITHM
     A technical description of algorithmic aspects, describing exactly how
     the key aspects of the application work.
-->
<a name="10.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 10.0  ALGORITHM                 </H2>

The algorithm is based on an approach first described in Daniel et al (1999) 
that was applied to the definition of protein families (Ison et al, 2000)
and later to automatically-generated signatures (Blades et al, 2005).

<br><br><B>Description of scoring modes</B><br>
The user specifies the mode of scoring ligands, i.e. the way in which the scores in the results files are generated. In 'Patch Score Mode' (mode 1) the score for a ligand is the mean of its patch scores.  In 'Site Score Mode' the score for a ligand is the mean of its site scores.  A site score is the mean of patch score for all patches for a given site.

<br><br><B>Selection of gap penalties</B><br>
The user specifies the gap insertion and extension penalties. The gap insertion penalty is the score taken away when a gap is created. The gap extension penalty is added to the standard gap penalty for each base or residue in the gap. This is how long gaps are penalized.  Usually you will expect a few long gaps rather than many short gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be lower than the gap penalty. The best value of these penalties depends on the choice of comparison matrix. The default value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62 matrix for 1D signature scans.  If you are performing 3D signature scans you should select a value appropriate to the scoring matrix used.
