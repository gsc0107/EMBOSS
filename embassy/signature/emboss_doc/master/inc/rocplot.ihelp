  [-hitsfilespath]     dirlist    [rocplot] This option specifies the
                                  directory of hits files (input). A 'hits
                                  file'contains a list of hits (e.g. from a
                                  prediction method) that are classified and
                                  rank-ordered on the basis of score, p-value,
                                  E-value etc. The files generated by using
                                  SIGSCAN and LIBSCAN will contain the results
                                  of a search of a discriminating element
                                  (e.g. hidden Markov model, profile or
                                  signature) against a sequence database. The
                                  ROCPLOT application is run on the files to
                                  perform Receiver Operator Characteristic
                                  (ROC) analysis on the hits.
   -mode               menu       [1] This option specifies the mode of
                                  ROCPLOT operation (main mode). In 'single
                                  input file mode', ROC analysis is performed
                                  on the individual hits file; a ROC plot
                                  containing a single ROC curve, and a single
                                  ROC value and classification plot are
                                  generated. In 'multiple input file mode'
                                  there are two sub-modes depending upon
                                  whether (1) ROC analysis is to performed
                                  separately for the individual input files or
                                  (2) the lists of hits in the hits files are
                                  combined and ROC analysis is performed on
                                  the whole (see the ACD option called
                                  'multimode' for more information). If the
                                  input file does not contain at least as many
                                  'FALSE' hits as are specified after the
                                  'ROC' token in the input file, then an error
                                  will be generated and rocplot will
                                  terminate. Where multiple input files are
                                  given as input, each must contain the same
                                  value after the 'ROC' token, or an error
                                  will be generated and rocplot will
                                  terminate. The hits in the hits files *must*
                                  have been rank-ordered on the basis of
                                  score, p-value, E-value etc, with the
                                  highest scoring / most significant hit being
                                  given in the highest rank (1); i.e. on the
                                  second line of the file. Other hits should
                                  then be given in order of decreasing score /
                                  significance. (Values: 1 (Single input file
                                  mode); 2 (Multiple input file mode))
*  -multimode          menu       [1] This option specifies the mode of
                                  ROCPLOT operation (multimode). In 'Do not
                                  combine data' mode, ROC analysis is
                                  performed separately for the individual
                                  input files. Multiple ROC curves will be
                                  given on the same ROC plot and a ROC value
                                  and a classification plot will be generated
                                  for each input file. A bar chart giving the
                                  distribution of ROCn values, and the mean
                                  and standard deviation of ROCn values are
                                  also generated. In 'Combine data' mode, the
                                  lists of hits in the hits files are combined
                                  and ROC analysis is performed on the whole.
                                  A single ROC curve will be given in the ROC
                                  plot and a single ROC value and
                                  classification plot will be generated. In
                                  this second mode there are two further
                                  sub-modes depending on whether there is (1)
                                  a single list of known true relatives for
                                  the different searches or (2) there is a
                                  different list of known true relatives for
                                  each different search (see the ACD option
                                  called 'datamode' for more information)

*  -datamode           menu       [1] This option specifies the mode of
                                  ROCPLOT operation (datamode). This determine
                                  how the ROC number and value are calculated
                                  in cases where there are multiple input
                                  files (lists of hits) and the user has
                                  specified the data are to be combined. See
                                  rocplot.c for more information. (Values: 1

*  -thresh             integer    [10] This option specifies the overlap
                                  threshold for hits. In cases where the lists
                                  of hits are to be combined and there is a
                                  single set of relatives, the accession
                                  number (or other database identifier code)
                                  of the hit, and the start and end point
                                  respectively of the hit relative to full
                                  length sequence must be provided in the
                                  lists of hits (see 'Input file format'
                                  below). rocplot ensures that only unique
                                  hits are counted when calculating SENS and
                                  SPEC; two hits are 'unique' if they have (i)
                                  different accesssion numbers or (ii) the
                                  same accession numbers but which do not
                                  overlap by any more than a user-defined
                                  number of residues. The overlap is
                                  determined from the start and end points of
                                  the hit. For example two hits both with the
                                  same accession numbers and with the start
                                  and end points of 1-100 and 91 - 190
                                  respectively are considered to be the same
                                  hit if the overlap threshold is 10 or less.

  [-outdir]            outdir     [./] This option specifies the directory
                                  where output files are written.
  [-rocbasename]       string     [_rocplot] This option specifies the base
                                  name of ROC plot file(s) (output). A file of
                                  meta data that contains graphs that
                                  illustrate the diagnostic performance of the
                                  discriminator. rocplot generates Receiver
                                  Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, that
                                  display graphically the sensitivity and
                                  specificity of discriminating elements, and
                                  accompanying ROC value(s), which are a
                                  convenient numerical measure of the
                                  sensitivity and specificity of a method.
                                  Classification plots, which are a valuable
                                  aid in interpreting the ROC plot and value,
                                  are also generated and, depending upon the
                                  mode rocplot is run in, a plot of the
                                  distribution of ROC values. (Any string is

*  -barbasename        string     [_barchart] This option specifies the base
                                  name of bar chart for ROC value distribution
                                  (output). A bar chart giving the
                                  distribution of ROCn values will be
                                  generated when multiple input files (lists
                                  of hits) are provided and the user has

                                  (output). Classification plots are a
                                  valuable aid in interpreting the ROC plot
                                  and value. A single plot will be generated
                                  where a single input file is provided or
                                  where multiple input files are provided and
