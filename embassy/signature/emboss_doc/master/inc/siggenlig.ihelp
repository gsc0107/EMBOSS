   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-confile]           infile     This option specifies the name of the CON
                                  file (contact file) (input). A 'contact
                                  file' contains contact data for a protein or
                                  a domain from SCOP or CATH, in the CON
                                  format (EMBL-like). The contacts may be
                                  intra-chain residue-residue, inter-chain
                                  residue-residue or residue-ligand. The files
                                  are generated by using CONTACTS, INTERFACE
                                  and SITES.
   -ccfpdir            directory  This option specifies the location of
                                  protein CCF file (clean coordinate files)
                                  (input). A 'clean cordinate file' contains
                                  protein coordinate and derived data for a
                                  single PDB file ('protein clean coordinate
                                  file') or a single domain from SCOP or CATH
                                  ('domain clean coordinate file'), in CCF
                                  format (EMBL-like). The files, generated by
                                  using PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER
                                  (domains), contain 'cleaned-up' data that is
                                  self-consistent and error-corrected.
                                  Records for residue solvent accessibility
                                  and secondary structure are added to the
                                  file by using PDBPLUS. default: ./
   -ccfddir            directory  This option specifies the location of
                                  protein CCF file (clean coordinate files)
                                  (input). A 'clean cordinate file' contains
                                  protein coordinate and derived data for a
                                  single PDB file ('protein clean coordinate
                                  file') or a single domain from SCOP or CATH
                                  ('domain clean coordinate file'), in CCF
                                  format (EMBL-like). The files, generated by
                                  using PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER
                                  (domains), contain 'cleaned-up' data that is
                                  self-consistent and error-corrected.
                                  Records for residue solvent accessibility
                                  and secondary structure are added to the
                                  file by using PDBPLUS. default: ./
   -mode               menu       [1] This option specifies the mode of
                                  signature generation. In 'Full-length
                                  signature mode' (mode 1) a single signature
                                  incorporating all residue positions that
                                  contact the ligand plus intervening gaps is
                                  generated. In 'Patch signature mode' (mode
                                  2) one or more signatures corresponding to
                                  'patches' of residue positions are
                                  generated. A patch is a set of residues that
                                  are near-neighbours in sequence and is
                                  described by two user-defined parameters:
                                  minimum patch size and maximum gap distance.
                                  (Values: 1 (Full-length signature mode); 2
                                  (Patch signature mode))
   -type               menu       [1] This option specifies the type of
                                  signature generated. In '1D (sequence)
                                  signature' sequence-based signatures are
                                  generated. In '3D (structural) signature'
                                  structure-based signatures are generated.
                                  (Values: 1 (1D (sequence) signature); 2 (3D
                                  (structural) signature))
*  -patchsize          integer    [5] This option specifies the minimum patch
                                  size. This is the minimum number of contact
                                  positions that must be incorporated in a
                                  signature. (Integer 3 or more)
*  -gapdistance        integer    [2] This option specifies the maximum gap
                                  distance. This is the maximum allowable gap
                                  (residues) between two residue in a patch.
                                  If two contact residues are further than
                                  this distance apart in sequence, they would
                                  not belong to the same patch. (Integer 0 or
                                  more)
*  -environment        menu       [1] This option specifies the environment
                                  definition. See matgen3d documentation for
                                  description of definitions. (Values: 1
                                  (Env1); 2 (Env2); 3 (Env3); 4 (Env4); 5
                                  (Env5); 6 (Env6); 7 (Env7); 8 (Env8); 9
                                  (Env9); 10 (Env10); 11 (Env11); 12 (Env12);

                                  (Env16))
   -wsiz               integer    [0] This option specifies the window size.
                                  When a signature is aligned to a protein
                                  sequence, the permissible gaps between two
                                  signature positions is determined by the
                                  empirical gaps and the window size. The user
                                  is prompted for a window size that is used
                                  for every position in the signature. Likely
                                  this is not optimal. A future implementation
                                  will provide a range of methods for
                                  generating values of window size depending
                                  upon the alignment (window size is
                                  identified by the WSIZ record in the
                                  signature output file). (Any integer value)
  [-sigoutdir]         outdir     [./] This option specifies the location of
                                  signature files (output). A 'signature file'
                                  contains a sparse sequence signature
                                  suitable for use with the SIGSCAN and
                                  SIGSCANLIG programs. The files are generated
                                  by using SIGGEN and SIGGENLIG.
