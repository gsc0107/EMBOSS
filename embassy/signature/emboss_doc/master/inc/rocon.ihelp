   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-hitsinfile]        infile     This option specifies the location of the
                                  DHF file (domain hits file) (input). A
                                  'domain hits file' contains database hits
                                  (sequences) with domain classification
                                  information, in the DHF format (FASTA or
                                  EMBL-like). The hits are relatives to a SCOP
                                  or CATH family and are found from a search
                                  of a sequence database. Files containing
                                  hits retrieved by PSIBLAST are generated by
                                  using SEQSEARCH, hits retrieved by a sparse
                                  protein signatare by using SIGSCAN or
                                  various types of HMM and profile by using
                                  LIBSCAN.
  [-validinfile]       infile     This option specifies the name of domain
                                  families file (input). A 'domain families
                                  file' contains sequence relatives (hits) for
                                  each of a number of different SCOP or CATH
                                  families found from searching a sequence
                                  database, e.g. by using SEQSEARCH
                                  (psiblast). The file contains the collated
                                  search results for the indvidual families;
                                  only those hits of unambiguous family
                                  assignment are included. Hits of ambiguous
                                  family assignment are assigned as relatives
                                  to a SCOP or CATH superfamily or fold
                                  instead and are collated into a 'domain
                                  ambiguities file'. The domain families and
                                  ambiguities files are generated by using
                                  SEQSORT and use the same format as a DHF
                                  file (domain hits file).
   -thresh             integer    [10] This option specifies the overlap
                                  threshold for hits. This is the minimum
                                  length (residues) of overlap required for
                                  two hits with the accession number to be
                                  counted as the same hit. The accession
                                  number of the hit, and the start and end
                                  point respectively of the hit relative to
                                  full length sequence are provided in the
                                  lists of hits in the DHF input file. The
                                  overlap is determined from the start and end
                                  points of the hit. For example two hits
                                  with the start and end points of 1-100 and
                                  91-190 respectively are considered to be the
                                  same hit if they have the same accession
                                  numbers and the overlap threshold is 10 or
                                  less. (Any integer value)
   -mode               menu       [1] This option specifies the classification
                                  scheme to use. See ROCON on-line
                                  documentation for more information. (Values:
                                  1 (Family classification scheme); 2 ((Not
                                  yet available)))
  [-hitsoutfile]       outfile    [*.rocon] This option specifies the name of
                                  the hits files (output). A 'hits
                                  file'contains a list of hits (e.g. from a
                                  prediction method) that are classified and
                                  rank-ordered on the basis of score, p-value,
                                  E-value etc. The files generated by using
                                  SIGSCAN and LIBSCAN will contain the results
                                  of a search of a discriminating element
                                  (e.g. hidden Markov model, profile or
                                  signature) against a sequence database. The
                                  ROCPLOT application is run on the files to
                                  perform Receiver Operator Characteristic
                                  (ROC) analysis on the hits.
