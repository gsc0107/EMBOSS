<tr>
<td>[-hitsfilespath]<br>(Parameter 1)</td>
<td>This option specifies the directory of hits files (input). A 'hits file'contains a list of hits (e.g. from a prediction method) that are classified and rank-ordered on the basis of score, p-value, E-value etc. The files generated by using SIGSCAN and LIBSCAN will contain the results of a search of a discriminating element (e.g. hidden Markov model, profile or signature) against a sequence database. The ROCPLOT application is run on the files to perform Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis on the hits.</td>

<tr>
<td>-mode</td>
<td>This option specifies the mode of ROCPLOT operation (main mode). In 'single input file mode', ROC analysis is performed on the individual hits file; a ROC plot containing a single ROC curve, and a single ROC value and classification plot are generated. In 'multiple input file mode' there are two sub-modes depending upon whether (1) ROC analysis is to performed separately for the individual input files or (2) the lists of hits in the hits files are combined and ROC analysis is performed on the whole (see the ACD option called 'multimode' for more information). If the input file does not contain at least as many 'FALSE' hits as are specified after the 'ROC' token in the input file, then an error will be generated and rocplot will terminate. Where multiple input files are given as input, each must contain the same value after the 'ROC' token, or an error will be generated and rocplot will terminate. The hits in the hits files *must* have been rank-ordered on the basis of score, p-value, E-value etc, with the highest scoring / most significant hit being given in the highest rank (1); i.e. on the second line of the file. Other hits should then be given in order of decreasing score / significance.</td>

<tr>
<td>-multimode</td>
<td>This option specifies the mode of ROCPLOT operation (multimode). In 'Do not combine data' mode, ROC analysis is performed separately for the individual input files. Multiple ROC curves will be given on the same ROC plot and a ROC value and a classification plot will be generated for each input file. A bar chart giving the distribution of ROCn values, and the mean and standard deviation of ROCn values are also generated. In 'Combine data' mode, the lists of hits in the hits files are combined and ROC analysis is performed on the whole. A single ROC curve will be given in the ROC plot and a single ROC value and classification plot will be generated. In this second mode there are two further sub-modes depending on whether there is (1) a single list of known true relatives for the different searches or (2) there is a different list of known true relatives for each different search (see the ACD option called 'datamode' for more information)</td>

<td>-datamode</td>

<tr>
<td>-thresh</td>
<td>This option specifies the overlap threshold for hits. In cases where the lists of hits are to be combined and there is a single set of relatives, the accession number (or other database identifier code) of the hit, and the start and end point respectively of the hit relative to full length sequence must be provided in the lists of hits (see 'Input file format' below). rocplot ensures that only unique hits are counted when calculating SENS and SPEC; two hits are 'unique' if they have (i) different accesssion numbers or (ii) the same accession numbers but which do not overlap by any more than a user-defined number of residues. The overlap is determined from the start and end points of the hit. For example two hits both with the same accession numbers and with the start and end points of 1-100 and 91 - 190 respectively are considered to be the same hit if the overlap threshold is 10 or less.</td>

<tr>
<td>[-rocbasename]<br>(Parameter 3)</td>
<td>This option specifies the base name of ROC plot file(s) (output). A file of meta data that contains graphs that illustrate the diagnostic performance of the discriminator. rocplot generates Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, that display graphically the sensitivity and specificity of discriminating elements, and accompanying ROC value(s), which are a convenient numerical measure of the sensitivity and specificity of a method. Classification plots, which are a valuable aid in interpreting the ROC plot and value, are also generated and, depending upon the mode rocplot is run in, a plot of the distribution of ROC values.</td>

<tr>
<td>-classbasename</td>
<td>This option specifies the base name of classification plot file(s) (output). Classification plots are a valuable aid in interpreting the ROC plot and value.
