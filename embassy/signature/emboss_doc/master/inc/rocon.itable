<tr>
<td>[-hitsinfile]<br>(Parameter 1)</td>
<td>This option specifies the location of the DHF file (domain hits file) (input). A 'domain hits file' contains database hits (sequences) with domain classification information, in the DHF format (FASTA or EMBL-like). The hits are relatives to a SCOP or CATH family and are found from a search of a sequence database. Files containing hits retrieved by PSIBLAST are generated by using SEQSEARCH, hits retrieved by a sparse protein signatare by using SIGSCAN or various types of HMM and profile by using LIBSCAN.</td>
<td>Input file</td>
<td><b>Required</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>[-validinfile]<br>(Parameter 2)</td>
<td>This option specifies the name of domain families file (input). A 'domain families file' contains sequence relatives (hits) for each of a number of different SCOP or CATH families found from searching a sequence database, e.g. by using SEQSEARCH (psiblast). The file contains the collated search results for the indvidual families; only those hits of unambiguous family assignment are included. Hits of ambiguous family assignment are assigned as relatives to a SCOP or CATH superfamily or fold instead and are collated into a 'domain ambiguities file'. The domain families and ambiguities files are generated by using SEQSORT and use the same format as a DHF file (domain hits file).</td>
<td>Input file</td>
<td><b>Required</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-thresh</td>
<td>This option specifies the overlap threshold for hits. This is the minimum length (residues) of overlap required for two hits with the accession number to be counted as the same hit. The accession number of the hit, and the start and end point respectively of the hit relative to full length sequence are provided in the lists of hits in the DHF input file. The overlap is determined from the start and end points of the hit. For example two hits with the start and end points of 1-100 and 91-190 respectively are considered to be the same hit if they have the same accession numbers and the overlap threshold is 10 or less.</td>
<td>Any integer value</td>
<td>10</td>

<tr>
<td>-mode</td>
<td>This option specifies the classification scheme to use. See ROCON on-line documentation for more information.</td>

<tr>
<td>[-hitsoutfile]<br>(Parameter 3)</td>
<td>This option specifies the name of the hits files (output). A 'hits file'contains a list of hits (e.g. from a prediction method) that are classified and rank-ordered on the basis of score, p-value, E-value etc. The files generated by using SIGSCAN and LIBSCAN will contain the results of a search of a discriminating element (e.g. hidden Markov model, profile or signature) against a sequence database. The ROCPLOT application is run on the files to perform Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis on the hits.</td>
