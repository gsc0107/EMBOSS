    Description
</H2>TOPO creates an image of a transmembrane region but the user must give
the transmembrane regions for the sequence as it does not
calculate these. 
<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

    Notes
</H2>As you can see the lists above the are alot of options to choose for
the displays of acidic, basic amino acids etc. This can be explained
simply as :-<p>
One letter codes are black filled shaped EXCEPT for "N" which means
NONE (no shape).<p>
For two letter codes the first letter is the shape and the second the
colour except for "F" which means NO FILL.<p>
For the signatures you need to input sets of start position, end
    position and code. For the example given these are 74 82 sy 189
    189 hm 239 239 sa 157 157 sa 262 262 sa
<pre>
So residues 74 to 82 will have Yellow Squares (sy).
   residue 189 (i.e. 189 to 189) will have a Magenta Hexagon. (hm)          
</pre>
