MIRAest fragment assembly program
Version: EMBOSS:6.1.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
   -project            string     [mira] Default is mira. Defines the project
                                  name for this assembly. The project name
                                  automatically influences the name of input
                                  and output files / directories. E.g. in the
                                  default setting, the file names for the
                                  output of the assembly in FASTA format would
                                  be mira_out.fasta and mira_out.fasta.qual.
                                  Setting the project name to 'MyProject'
                                  would generate MyProject_out.fasta and
                                  MyProject_out.fasta.qual. (Any string)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -paramsfile         infile     Loads parameters from the filename given.
                                  Allows a maximum of 10 levels of recursion,
                                  i.e. a -params option appearing within a
                                  file that loads other parameter files
   -setparam           menu       [unspecified] Sets parameters suited for
                                  loading sequences from FASTA, PHD or CAF
                                  files. The default is not to specify the
                                  type of input file. (Values: unspecified
                                  (Unspecified); fasta (Fasta); phd (PHD); caf
                                  (CAF))
   -expdir             directory  [.] Defines the directory where mira should
                                  search for experiment files (EXP).
   -scfdir             directory  [.] Defines the directory where mira should
                                  search for SCF files
   -feifile            infile     [mira_in.fofn] Defines the file of filenames
                                  where the names of the EXP files of a
                                  project are located.
   -fpifile            infile     [mira_in.fofn] Defines the file of filenames
                                  where the names of the PHD files of a
                                  project are located.
   -pifile             infile     [mira_in.phd] Defines the PHD file to load
                                  sequences of a project from.
   -faifile            infile     [mira_in.fasta] Defines the FASTA file to
                                  load sequences of a project from.

                                  to load base qualities of a project from.
                                  Although the order of reads in the quality
                                  file does not need to be the same as in the
                                  fasta or fofn projects (although it saves a
                                  bit of time if they are).
   -cifile             infile     [mira_in.caf] Defines the file to load a CAF
                                  project from. Filename must end with
                                  '.caf'.
   -sdifile            infile     [mira_straindata_in.txt] Defines the file to
                                  load straindata from. Only used in EST
                                  projects (miraEST).
   -xtiifile           infile     [mira_xmltraceinfo_in.xml] Defines the file
                                  to load a trace info file in XML format
                                  from. This can be used both when merging XML
                                  data to loaded files or when loading a
                                  project from an XML trace info file.
   -genome             menu       [normal] Quality grades of de-novo genome
                                  assembly. Draft is quick-and-dirty, suited
                                  to get a first look on approximate coverage
                                  of a running project. Should not be used for
                                  anything else. Normal is the default
                                  parameter set of mira that is able to tackle
                                  most genomes. A bit slower than the draft
                                  version, but includes such options as read
                                  extension and vector remnant clipping.
                                  Accurate is still slower than the normal
                                  mode but should be used for genomes that
                                  pose a problem to the normal mode. (Values:
                                  draft (Draft); normal (Normal); accurate
                                  (Accurate))
   -mapping            menu       [normal] Work like the -genome switches
                                  except they are to be used when performing
                                  mapping assemblies against given backbone
                                  sequences. (Values: draft (Draft); normal
                                  (Normal); accurate (Accurate))
   -clipping           menu       [medium] Three clipping grade modifiers,
                                  from light clipping when working with well
                                  preprocessed sequences to heavy clipping
                                  when the sequences that are being assembled
                                  had only sloppy or no preprocessing. Note 1

                                  the -genome and -mapping switches. Note 2 -
                                  it is recommended that you perform a
                                  thorough preprocessing (clipping sequencing
                                  vector stretches, clipping of low quality
                                  bases, tagging standard repeats etc.) before
                                  assembling sequences. The clipping routines
                                  of mira are more optimised to cope with the
                                  last remnants of wrongly preprocessed
                                  sequences than with sequences having had no
                                  pre-processing at all. (Values: light

   -highlyrepetitive   boolean    [N] A modifier switch for genome data that
                                  is deemed to be highly repetitive. The
                                  assemblies will run slower due to more
                                  iterative cycles that give mira a chance to
                                  resolve nasty repeats.
   -highqualitydata    boolean    [N] A modifier switch when the sequences
                                  that are used are of exceptional quality.
                                  mira will then bump up a few quality
                                  parameters which should lead to less false
                                  positives in the repeat and SNP detection
                                  routines.
   -estmode            boolean    [N] Switches mira to a good initial preset
                                  for assembling EST data. Note that this is
                                  not needed (and even counterproductive) when
                                  used with miraEST.
   -horrid             boolean    [N] Sets a number of parameters useful when
                                  dealing with really horrid data sets. Useful
                                  means that parameters are chosen to so that
                                  time and memory consumption do not explode
                                  beyond all hope of the program returning.
                                  Note that MIRA will return in most cases
                                  useful assemblies with this switch, but
                                  these might not be as optimised as with
                                  normal operation. The definition of 'horrid'
                                  is a bit flexible, for example, (a) a
                                  genomic projects with more than 2.000 reads
                                  that all seem to align partly to each other
                                  but have different repetitive structures or
                                  (b) EST clusters with a few thousand almost
                                  similar reads.
   -borg               boolean    [N] Sets several parameters to have mira try
                                  to assemble as many reads as possible. Will
                                  probably slow down the assembly process and
                                  use more memory. 'We are MIRA of borg. You
                                  will be assembled, resistance is futile!'

                                  assembled and no assembly output files will
                                  be produced. Instead, the project files will
                                  only be loaded. This switch is useful for
                                  checking consistency of input files.
   -mxti               boolean    [N] Some file formats above (FASTA, PHD or

                                  of an assembly. Should additional

                                  etc., be available in a XML trace info file
                                  in NCBI format (see File formats), then set
                                  this option to 'Y' and it will be merged to
                                  the data loaded. Please note, quality

                                  supported out of the box. How to choose?

                                  This might be of use in case some
                                  post-processing software fiddles around with

                                  sequence (e.g. the base sequence read from a
                                  SCF file does not match the originally read
                                  base sequence), should the read be excluded
                                  from assembly or not. If not, it will use
                                  the qualities it had before trying to load
                                  the external qualities (either default

                                  template form a read pair with a known
                                  minimum and maximum distance. This feature
                                  will definitively help for contigs
                                  containing lots of repeats. Set this to 'Y'
                                  if your data contains information on insert

                                  given via the SI tag in EXP files (for each
                                  read pair individually), or for the whole

   -ess                integer    [1] Controls the starting step of the EST
                                  assembly and is therefore only useful in
                                  miraEST. EST assembly is a three step
                                  process, each with different settings to the
                                  assembly engine, with the result of each
                                  step being saved to disk. If results of
                                  previous steps are present in a directory,
                                  one can easily 'play around' with different
                                  setting for subsequent steps by reusing the
                                  results of the previous steps and directly
                                  starting with step two or three. (Integer

                                  printed out during the assembly. Suppressing
                                  it isn't useful in normal operation, only
                                  when debugging or benchmarking.
   -lsd                boolean    [N] Straindata is a key value file, one read
                                  per line. First the name of the read, then
                                  the strain name of the organism the read
                                  comes from. It is used by the program to
                                  differentiate different types of SNPs
                                  appearing in organisms and classifying them.
   -lb                 boolean    [N] A backbone is a sequence (or a previous
                                  assembly) that is used as a template for the
                                  current assembly. The current assembly
                                  process will first assemble reads to loaded
                                  backbone contigs before creating new
                                  contigs. This feature is helpful for
                                  assembling against previous (and already
                                  possibly edited) assembly iterations, or to
                                  make a comparative assembly of two very
                                  closely related organisms. Please read 'very

                                  or short indels present'.
   -sbuip              integer    [3] When assembling against backbones, this
                                  parameter defines the pass iteration (see
                                  nop) from which on the backbones will be
                                  really used. In the passes preceding this
                                  number, the non-backbone reads will be
                                  assembled together as if no backbones
                                  existed. This allows mira to correctly spot
                                  repetitive stretches that differ by single
                                  bases and tag them accordingly. Rule of
                                  thumb - if backbones belong to the same
                                  strain as the reads to assemble, set to 1.
                                  If backbones are a different strain, then
                                  set sbuib to 1 lower than nop (example - nop
                                  4 and sbuip 3). (Integer 1 or more)

                                  1000 to 3000)
   -bbq                integer    [-1] Defines the default quality that the
                                  backbone sequences have if they came without
                                  quality values in their files (like in GBF
                                  format or when FASTA is used without .qual
                                  files). A value of -1 causes mira to use the
                                  same default quality for backbones as for
                                  reads. (Integer from -1 to 100)
   -[no]abnc           boolean    [Y] The standard mode of the assembler is to
                                  assemble available reads to a backbone and
                                  make new contigs with the remaining reads.
                                  If this option is set to 'N', the reads that
                                  cannot be assembled into existing contigs
                                  are put as singlets into the assembly, not
                                  forming new contigs.
   -mrl                integer    [40] Minimum length that reads must have to
                                  be considered for the assembly. Shorter
                                  sequences will be filtered out at the
                                  beginning of the process and won't be
                                  present in the final project. (Integer 20 or
                                  more)
   -nop                integer    [3] Defines how many iterations of the whole
                                  assembly process are done. Rule of thumb -
                                  for quick and dirty assembly use 1 (not
                                  recommended). For assembly using read
                                  extensions and / or automatic contig editing
                                  (-ure and -ace) use at least 2. The
                                  recommended setting is 3 or higher, as some
                                  knowledge generated by the assembler can be
                                  used only from the third iteration on. More
                                  than 3 passes might be useful for projects
                                  containing many repetitive elements. See
                                  also -rbl and -mr for parameters that affect
                                  the assembly and disentanglement of
                                  possible repeats. (Integer 1 or more)
   -[no]sep            boolean    [Y] Defines whether the skim algorithm (and
                                  with it also the recalculation of
                                  Smith-Waterman alignments) is called in
                                  between each main pass. If set to 'N',
                                  skimming is done only when needed by the
                                  workflow, either when read extensions are
                                  searched for (-ure) or when possible vector
                                  leftovers are to be clipped (-pvc). Setting
                                  this option to 'Y' is highly recommended,
                                  setting it to 'N' is only for quick and
                                  dirty assemblies.
   -rbl                integer    [2] Defines the maximum number of times a
                                  contig can be rebuilt during main assembly
                                  passes (-nop) if misassemblies, due to
                                  possible repeats, are found. (Integer 1 or
                                  more)
   -sd                 boolean    [N] Default is 'Y' for mira and 'N' for
                                  miraEST. A spoiler can be either a chimeric
                                  read or it is a read with long parts of
                                  unclipped vector sequence still included
                                  (that was too long for the -pvc vector
                                  leftover clipping routines). A spoiler
                                  typically prevents contigs being joined;
                                  MIRA will cut them back so that they present
                                  no more harm to the assembly. Recommended
                                  for assemblies of mid-to-high coverage
                                  genomic assemblies; not recommended for
                                  assemblies of ESTs as one might lose splice
                                  variants with that. A minimum number of two
                                  assembly passes (-nop) must be run for this
                                  option to take effect.
   -[no]sdlpo          boolean    [Y] Defines whether the spoiler detection
                                  algorithms are run only for the last pass or
                                  for all passes (-nop). Takes effect only if
                                  spoiler detection (-sd) is on.
   -bdq                integer    [10] Defines the default base quality of
                                  reads that have no quality read from a file.
                                  (Integer 0 or more)
   -[no]ugpf           boolean    [Y] MIRA has two different pathfinder
                                  algorithms it chooses from to find its way
                                  through the (more or less) complete set of
                                  possible sequence overlaps; a genomic and an
                                  EST pathfinder. The genomic looks a bit
                                  into the future of the assembly and tries to
                                  stay on safe grounds using a maximum of
                                  information already present in the contig
                                  that is being built. The EST version, on the
                                  contrary, will directly jump at the complex
                                  cases posed by very similar repetitive
                                  sequences and try to solve those first; it
                                  is willing to fall down to brute force when
                                  really bad cases (such as coverage with
                                  thousands of sequences) are encountered.
                                  Generally, the genomic pathfinder will also
                                  work quite well with EST sequences (but
                                  might get slowed down a lot in pathological
                                  cases), while the EST algorithm does not
                                  work so well on genomes. If in doubt,
                                  leaveas 'Y' for genome projects and set to
                                  'N' for EST projects.
   -[no]uess           boolean    [Y] Another important switch if you plan to
                                  assemble non-normalised EST libraries, where
                                  some ESTs may reach coverages of several
                                  hundreds or thousands of reads. This switch
                                  lets MIRA save a lot of computational time
                                  when aligning those extremely high coverage
                                  areas (but only there), at the expense of
                                  some accuracy.
   -esspd              integer    [500] Defines the number of potential

                                  into emergency search stop mode for that
                                  read. (Integer 1 or more)
   -umcbt              boolean    [N] Defines whether there is an upper limit
                                  of time to be used to build one contig. Set
                                  this to 'Y' in EST assemblies where you
                                  think that extremely high coverages occur.
                                  Less useful for assembly of genomic
                                  sequences.
   -bts                integer    [10000] Depending on -umcbt above, this
                                  number defines the time in seconds alloted
                                  to building one contig. (Integer 1 or more)
   -[no]ure            boolean    [Y] Defines whether there is an upper limit
                                  of time to be used to build one contig. Set
                                  this to 'Y' in EST assemblies where you
                                  think that extremely high coverages occur.

   -rewl               integer    [30] Only takes effect when -ure is set to
                                  'Y'. The read extension routines use a
                                  sliding window approach on Smith-Waterman
                                  alignments. This parameter defines the

                                  alignments. This parameter defines the
                                  number maximum number of errors
                                  (disagreements) between two alignments in

   -feip               integer    [0] Only takes effect when -ure is set to
                                  'Y'. The read extension routines can be
                                  called before assembly and/or after each
                                  assembly pass (see -nop). This parameter
                                  defines the first pass in which the read
                                  extension routines are called. The default
                                  of 0 tells mira to extend the reads the
                                  first time before the first assembly pass.

                                  assembly pass (see -nop). This parameter
                                  defines the last pass in which the read
                                  extension routines are called. The default
                                  of 0 tells mira to extend the reads the last
                                  time before the first assembly pass.

   -tpae               boolean    [N] This option is useful in EST assembly.
                                  Poly-AT stretches at the end of reads that
                                  were not correctly masked or clipped in
                                  pre-processing steps from external programs
                                  get tagged here. The assembler will not use
                                  these stretches for critical operations.
                                  Additionally, the tags do provide a good
                                  visual anchor when looking at the assembly
                                  with different programs.
   -pbwl               integer    [7] Only takes effect when -tpae is set to
                                  'Y'. Defines the window length within which
                                  all bases (except the maximum number of
                                  errors allowed) must be either A or T to be
                                  considered a polybase stretch. (Integer 1 or

                                  allowed in a given window length such that a
                                  stretch is considered to be a polybase
                                  stretch. The distribution of these errors is
                                  not important. (Integer 1 or more)
   -pbwgd              integer    [9] Only takes effect when -tpae is set to

                                  of the masked area) within which a polybase
                                  stretch is looked for without finding one.

   -[no]pvc            boolean    [Y] Mira will try to identify possible
                                  sequencing vector relicts present at the
                                  start of a sequence and clip them away.
                                  These relicts are usually a few bases long
                                  and were not correctly removed from the
                                  sequence in data pre-processing steps of
                                  external programs. You might want to turn
                                  off this option if you know (or think) that
                                  your data contains a lot of repeats and the

   -pvcmla             integer    [18] The clipping of possible vector relicts
                                  option works quite well. Unfortunately the
                                  bounds of repeats or differences in EST
                                  splice variants sometimes show the same
                                  alignment behaviour as possible sequencing
                                  vector relicts and could therefore also be
                                  clipped. To stop the vector clipping from
                                  mistakenly clipping repetitive regions or
                                  EST splice variants, this option puts an
                                  upper bound to the number of bases a
                                  potential clip is allowed to have. If the
                                  number of bases is below or equal to this
                                  threshold then the bases are clipped. If the
                                  number of bases exceeds the threshold then
                                  the clip is NOT performed. Setting the value
                                  to 0 turns off the threshold i.e. clips are
                                  then always performed if a potential vector
                                  is found. (Integer 0 or more)

                                  'fasta' or 'phd' (can be turned off again by
                                  subsequent options afterwards). This will
                                  let mira perform its own quality clipping
                                  before sequences are entered into the
                                  assembly. The clip function performed is a
                                  sequence end window quality clip with back
                                  iteration to get a maximum number of bases
                                  as useful sequence. Note that the bases
                                  clipped away here can still be used
                                  afterwards if there is enough evidence
                                  supporting their correctness when the option

                                  values here, because then the clipping will
                                  be too lax or too harsh. Values below 15 and
                                  higher than 35 are disallowed. (Integer

   -[no]mbc            boolean    [Y] This will let mira perform a 'clipping'
                                  of bases that were masked out (replaced with
                                  the character X). It is generally not a
                                  good idea to use mask bases to remove
                                  unwanted portions of a sequence; the EXP
                                  file format and the NCBI traceinfo format
                                  have excellent possibilities to circumvent
                                  this. But because a lot of pre-processing
                                  software is built around cross_match,
                                  scylla- and phrap-style base masking, the

                                  this too. mira will look at the start and
                                  end of each sequence to see whether there
                                  are masked bases that should be 'clipped'.

                                  bases, mira will look if it can merge larger
                                  chunks of masked bases that are a maximum
                                  of -mbcgs apart. (Integer 0 or more)

                                  bases at the start of a sequence, mira will
                                  allow up to this number of unmasked bases in

   -[no]emlc           boolean    [Y] If on, ensures a minimum left clip on

   -bph                integer    [14] Default is 14 on 32 bit systems and 16
                                  on 64 bit systems. Controls the number of
                                  consecutive bases n which are used as a word
                                  hash. The higher the value the faster the
                                  search. The lower the value the more weak
                                  matches are found. Values below 10 are not
                                  recommended. (Integer 1 or more)
   -hss                integer    [4] This is a parameter controlling the

                                  generated. This allows for a more
                                  fine-grained search as matches are now found
                                  with at least n+s (see -bph) equal bases
                                  instead of the SSAHA 2n. The higher the
                                  value the faster the search. The lower the
                                  value the more weak matches are found.
                                  (Integer 1 or more)
   -pr                 integer    [50] Controls the relative percentage of
                                  exact word matches in an approximate overlap
                                  that has to be reached to accept the
                                  overlap as a possible match. Increasing this
                                  number will decrease the number of possible
                                  alignments that have to be checked by
                                  Smith-Waterman later on in the assembly, but
                                  it might also lead to the rejection of
                                  weaker overlaps (i.e. overlaps that contain
                                  a higher number of mismatches). (Integer 1
                                  or more)
   -mhpr               integer    [200] Controls the maximum number of
                                  possible hits one read can maximally
                                  transport to the Smith-Waterman alignment
                                  phase. If more potential hits are found,
                                  only the best ones are taken. This is an
                                  important option for tackling projects that
                                  contain extreme assembly conditions. For
                                  example, 5000 reads that are all very
                                  similar would generate around 40 to 50
                                  million possible alignments (forward and
                                  reverse complement). Setting this parameter
                                  to 200 reduces the number of alignments to
                                  check to around 1.5-2 million. As the
                                  assembly increases in passes (-nop),
                                  different combinations of possible hits will
                                  be checked, always the probably best ones
                                  first. So the accuracy of the assembly
                                  should only suffer when lowering this number
                                  too much. (Integer 1 or more)
   -bip                integer    [15] The banded Smith-Waterman alignment
                                  uses this percentage number to compute the
                                  bandwidth it has to use when computing the
                                  alignment matrix. E.g. expected overlap is
                                  150 bases, bip=10 -> the banded SW will
                                  compute a band of 15 bases to each side of
                                  the expected alignment diagonal, thus
                                  allowing up to 15 unbalanced inserts /
                                  deletes in the alignment. INCREASING AND
                                  DECREASING THIS NUMBER - increasing will
                                  find more non-optimal alignments but will
                                  also increase SW runtime between linear and
                                  ^2, decreasing will work the other way round
                                  (it might miss a few bad alignments but
                                  gain speed). (Integer from 1 to 100)

                                  assembly. mira uses a default scoring scheme
                                  for SW align. Each match counts 1, a match
                                  with an N counts 0, each mismatch with a
                                  non-N base -1 and each gap -2. Use a bigger
                                  score to weed out a number of chance
                                  matches, a lower score to perhaps find the
                                  single (short) alignment that might join two
                                  contigs together (at the expense of
                                  computing time and memory). (Integer 1 or

                                  for assembly. Increasing this number will
                                  save memory but one might lose possible
                                  alignments. A maximum of 80 is probably
                                  sensible here. Decreasing below 55 will
                                  probably make memory and time consumption

   -rodirs             integer    [15] When adding reads to a contig, reject
                                  the reads if the drop in the quality of the

                                  values mean stricter checking. This value is
                                  doubled should a read be entered that has a
                                  template partner (a read pair) at the right

   -[no]mr             boolean    [Y] One of the most important switches in
                                  MIRA. If set to 'Y', MIRA will try to
                                  resolve misassemblies due to repeats by
                                  identifying single base stretch differences
                                  and tag those critical bases as RMB (Repeat
                                  Marker Base, weak or strong). This switch is
                                  also needed when MIRA is run in EST mode to
                                  identify possible inter-, intra- and
                                  intra-and-interorganism SNPs.
   -asir               boolean    [N] Only takes effect when -mr is set to
                                  'Y', effect is also dependent on the fact
                                  whether strain data (see -lsd) is present or
                                  not. Usually, mira will mark bases that
                                  differentiate between repeats, when a
                                  conflict occurs between reads that belong to
                                  one strain. If the conflict occurs between
                                  reads belonging to different strains they
                                  are marked as SNP. However, if this switch
                                  is set to 'Y',= then conflicts within a
                                  strain are also marked as SNP. This switch
                                  is mainly used in assemblies of ESTs; it
                                  should not be set for genomic assembly.
   -mrpg               integer    [2] Only takes effect when -mr is set to
                                  'Y'. This defines the minimum number of
                                  reads in a group that are needed for the RMB
                                  (Repeat Marker Bases) or SNP detection
                                  routines to be triggered. A group is defined
                                  by the reads carrying the same nucleotide
                                  for a given position, i.e., an assembly with
                                  mrpg=2 will need at least two times two
                                  reads with the same nucleotide (having at
                                  least a quality as defined in -mgqrt) to be
                                  recognised as repeat marker or a SNP.
                                  Setting this to a low number increases
                                  sensitivity, but might produce a few false
                                  positives, resulting in reads being thrown
                                  out of contigs because of falsely identified
                                  possible repeat markers (or wrongly
                                  recognised as SNP). (Integer 2 or more)
   -mgqrt              integer    [30] Only takes effect when -mr is set to
                                  'Y'. This defines the minimum quality of a
                                  group of bases to be taken into account as
                                  potential repeat marker. The lower the
                                  number, the more sensitive you get, but
                                  lowering below 25 is not recommended as a
                                  lot of wrongly called bases can have a
                                  quality approaching this value and you'd end
                                  up with a lot of false positives. The
                                  higher the overall coverage of your project
                                  the better, and the higher you can set this
                                  number. A value of 35 will probably remove
                                  all false positives, a value of 40 will
                                  probably never show false positives.

   -emea               integer    [15] Only takes effect when -mr is set to
                                  'Y'. Using the end of sequences of Sanger
                                  type shotgun sequencing is always a bit
                                  risky, as wrongly called bases tend to crowd
                                  there or some sequencing vector relicts
                                  hang around. It is even more risky to use
                                  these stretches for detecting possible
                                  repeats, so one can define an exclusion area
                                  where the bases are not used when
                                  determining whether a mismatch is due to
                                  repeats or not. (Integer 0 or more)
   -[no]amgb           boolean    [Y] Determines whether columns containing
                                  gap bases (indels) are also tagged.
   -[no]amgbemc        boolean    [Y] Only takes effect when -amgb is set to
                                  'Y'. Determines whether multiple columns
                                  containing gap bases (indels) are also
                                  tagged.
   -[no]amgbnbs        boolean    [Y] Only takes effect when -amgb is set to
                                  'Y'. Determines whether, for both tagging
                                  columns containing gap bases, both strands
                                  need to have a gap. Setting this to 'N' is
                                  not recommended except when working in
                                  desperately low coverage situations.
   -dismin             integer    [500] The minimum distance that read pairs
                                  may be apart. There is an additional error
                                  margin of 10% subtracted from this value
                                  during internal computations. (Integer 0 or
                                  more)
   -dismax             integer    [5000] The maximum distance that read pairs
                                  may be apart. There is an additional error
                                  margin of 10% added to this value during

   -ace                boolean    [N] Once contigs have been build, mira can
                                  call a built-in version of the automatic
                                  contig editor EdIt. EdIt will try to resolve
                                  discrepancies in the contig by performing
                                  trace analysis and correct even hard to
                                  resolve errors. This option is always
                                  useful, but especially in conjunction with
                                  -nop and -ure. Notice: the current
                                  development version has a memory leak in the
                                  editor, therefore the option is not
                                  automatically turned on.
   -[no]sem            boolean    [Y] If set to 'Y' the automatic editor will

                                  probability into account, even if all the

                                  rule set. Going below 40 is not

This is an important option for tackling projects that contain extreme assembly conditions. For example, 5000 reads that are all very similar would generate around 40 to 50 million possible alignments (forward and reverse complement). Setting this parameter to 200 reduces the number of alignments to check to around 1.5-2 million. As the assembly increases in passes (-nop), different combinations of possible hits will be checked, always the probably best ones first. So the accuracy of the assembly should only suffer when lowering this number too much.</td>

This program is an EMBOSS wrapper for a program written by Bastien
Chevreux as part of the MIRA package.

<p>
Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
before publication.

<p>
Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
not to the original author.
