  [-dcfinfile]         infile     This option specifies the name of DCF file
                                  (domain classification file) (input). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   -node               menu       This option specifies the node fore

                                  for any specified node in the SCOP or CATH
                                  hierarchies. For example by selecting
                                  'Class' entries belonging to the same Class
                                  will be reordered in turn.
  [-dcfoutfile]        outfile    This option specifies the name of DCF file
                                  (domain classification file) (output). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
