EMBOSS-MS

This is a beta port of the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite
to the Microsoft Windows platform. The port was done by the EMBOSS
developers using initial work by Andre Blavier as a starting point.

As this port was compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2005 you
may need to install the vcredist package from Microsoft before
installing this package. The vcredist package installs a handful
of runtime DLLs and is innocuous to any Windows system.

Please report any bugs to emboss-bug@emboss.open-bio.org
