Input file format

   aligncopypair reads any normal sequence USAs.

   [an error has occurred processing this directive]

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS alignment file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -aformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. Some of the alignment formats can cope
   with an unlimited number of sequences, while others are only for pairs
   of sequences.

   The available multiple alignment format names are: unknown, multiple,
   simple, fasta, msf, trace, srs

   The available pairwise alignment format names are: pair, markx0,
   markx1, markx2, markx3, markx10, srspair, score

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/AlignFormats.html for further
   information on alignment formats.

Data files

   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAFULL is used.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
