1.0 SUMMARY

   Reads DHF files (domain hits files) of database hits (sequences) and
   removes hits of ambiguous classification.

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   SEQSORT reads a directory of DHF files (domain hits files) where each
   file contains hits to a single SCOP family, compares, processes and
   collates the hits and writes a directory of DHF files which contain
   only those hits that could be uniquely assigned to a SCOP family.
   Optionally, two further files of hits are written: (i) a domain
   families file, of ALL hits from the input files that could be uniquely
   assigned to a SCOP family and (ii) a domain ambiguities file, of hits
   from ALL the input files that are of ambiguous family assignment and
   are assigned as relatives to a SCOP superfamily or fold instead.
   The path for the domain hits files (input and output) and the names of
   the output files are specified by the user. The file extension of the
   DHF files are set in the ACD file.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the domain hits file is described in SEQSEARCH
   documentation.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the domain hits file is described in SEQSEARCH
   documentation.
   The domain families file and domain ambiguities file also use the DHF
   format. Whereas normally a DHF file contains hits for a single node
   from SCOP or CATH, the families and ambiguities files may contain
   domains from multiple different families (domain families file), or
   superfamilies or folds (ambiguities file). Domains of the same node
   (e.g. family) will be grouped together in blocks, i.e. all hits for
   domain A, then all hits for domain B and so on (see Figure 1).

   All DHF files (of the file extension .dhf specicied in ACD) in
   directory /test_data were processed by SEQSORT. DHF output files were
   written to /test_data/seqsort/seqsort_hits. A shared segment of 10 or
   more identical was required to class two sequences as overlapping.
   Domain families and ambiguities files called fam.dhf and oth.dhf
   respectively were written to /test_data/seqsort.
   The following command line would achieve the same result.


seqsort /test_data /test_data/seqsort -overlap 10 -dofamilies Y -doambiguities

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   The results of multiple searches of a sequence database using an
   homology search tool such as blast may contain overlapping or
   identical hits, especially where the query sequences are related, for
   instance, belong to different families but the same superfamily. For
   certain analyses it is desirable to assign a hit with confidence to a
   unique family, or otherwise assign it as a member of a larger
   superfamily or fold instead. SEQSORT reads a directory of DHF files
   (domain hits files) where each file containing hits to a different
   SCOP family, compares, processes and collates the hits and writes a
   directory of DHF files which contain only those hits that could be
   uniquely assigned to a SCOP family. Optionally, two further files are
   written: (i) a domain families file, of hits (from ALL the input
   files) that could be uniquely assigned to a SCOP family and (ii) a
   domain ambiguities file, for hits (from ALL the input files) of
   ambiguous family assignment which are assigned as relatives to a SCOP
   superfamily or fold instead.

10.0 ALGORITHM

   A rough outline of the algorithm follows; a better description will
   appear in a publication in preparation. Hits from searches for all
   domain families are collated into a single list and the list sorted
   according to family name. The hits hits within each family are sorted
   by accession number, then hits within a family and with identical
   accession number are sorted by the start position of the hit relative
   to the full length sequence in swissprot. In each family identical
   hits (i.e. those with identical accession number and the same start
   and end points relative to the full-length sequence in swissprot) were
   removed leaving only a single copy. Each family is also processed so
   that ovlerapping hits (hits with identical accesssion number that
   overlap by at least a user-defined number of residues) are replaced by
   a hit that is produced from merging the two overlapping hits. If two
   hits have the same accession number and overlap but are from searches
   for different families, the hits are merged and the merged hit placed
   into a new list for hits to superfamilies (if the two families
   belonged to the same superfamily) or for hits to folds (if the two
   families were in different superfamilies but the same fold). In this
   way hits that are unique to a particular family are identified, and
   hits of ambiguous family assignment are assigned as belonging to a
   superfamily or fold instead.
