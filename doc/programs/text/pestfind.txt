Function

   Finds PEST motifs as potential proteolytic cleavage sites
   
Description

   pestfind finds PEST domains in a protein sequence.
   
   Proteins with intracellular half-lives of less than two hours are
   found to contain regions rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine and
   threonine (P, E, S and T). These so called PEST regions are generally
   flanked by clusters of positively charged amino acids.
   
   pestfind identifies possible PEST regions in a protein sequence using
   the Molecular fraction of the P, E, S and T components, and the
   hydrophobicity index of the region.
   
Algorithm

   The algorithm comprises first selecting all portions of a submitted
   sequence which correspond to the following Perl regular expression:
   
                    /([HKRhkr]|^\w)(\w*?)([HKRhkr]|\w$)/
                                      
   Or in English, the following sequence of conditions:
   
     * Either one of the residues H, K and R or the first residue in the
       sequence
     * The shortest sequence of residues excluding H, K and R
     * Either one of the residues H, K and R or the last residue in the
       sequence
       
   This isolates all of the initial candidate sequences. Following this
   selection, a set of inflexible rules are applied. First, the candidate
   sequence must be of at least the length specified at execution
   (default is 10 AAs). Next, the sequence must conform to the following
   Perl regular expression:
   
                       /P/ && /(?:D|E)/ && /(?:S|T)/
                                      
   Or in English, the following sequence of conditions:
   
     * Any residues including at least one P
     * Any residues including at least either one D or one E
     * Any residues including at least either one S or one T
       
   Once these conditions are met, we are left with a set of all candidate
   sequences from which we select the suitable members using the PEST
   SCORE algorithm. Since this gives us an arbitary cut off point, it is
   possible to ask for all candidate sequences with their PEST scores.
   PEST Scores are derived from two factors, the Molecular Fraction of
   the D, P, E, S and T components of the candidate and it's hydrophobic
   index.
   
   The PEDST molecular fraction is given by the following equation:
   
                         PEDST = 100 * (S - E) / T
                                      
   S = Total molecular weights of the P, E, D, S and T components of the
   candidate sequence
   E = Sum of the molecular weights of a single E, P and T Molecule (327)
   T = Total molecular weights of all amino acids within the candidate
   sequence
   
   The Hydrophobic index is given by the following equation:
   
                        HI = sum x=aa {H(x) * F(x)}
                                      
   H(x) = Hydrophobicity of amino acid (x)
   F(x) = Molar fraction of amino acid (x) within candidate sequence
   
   The PEST score is calculated from the PEDST molar fraction and the
   hydrophobic index from the following equation:
   
              PEST Score = -1 * ((HI * 0.5) - (PEDST * 0.55))
                                      
   A score in excess of the cut-off is recorded as a potential PEST
   sequence, so a low hydrophobicity index and a high PEDST score is most
   desirable.
