Description

   This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly
   or indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and
   scop. This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline
   described in an accompanying document. We provide the software in the
   hope that it will be useful. The applications were designed for
   specific research purposes and may not be useful or reliable in
   contexts other than the described pipeline. The development of the
   suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to whom enquiries and bug reports
   should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk). ** Knowledge of the
   physical contacts that amino acid residues within a protein or domain
   make with one another is required for several different analyses.
   contacts calculates intra-chain residue-residue contact data from
   protein and domain coordinate files.

Algorithm

   Contact between two residues is defined as when the van der Waals
   surface of any atom of the first residue comes within the threshold
   contact distance of the van der Waals surface of any atom of the
   second residue. The threshold contact distance is a user-defined
   distance with a default value of 1 Angstrom.

Input file format

   contacts reads any normal sequence USAs.

   The format of the clean coordinate file is described in pdbparse

Output file format

   contacts reads a directory of domain or protein coordinate files and
   writes a contacts file of intra-chain residue-residue contact data in
   embl-like format for each file in the input directory. Each output
   file contains residue contact data for every chain of every model in a
   protein coordinate file, or contact data for the single scop domain
   where a domain coordinate file is read. The paths and extensions for
   the coordinate (input) and contact (output) files are specified by the
   user. The scop domain or pdb identifier codes are used as appropriate
   to name the output files. A log file is also written.

   The embl-like format used for the contact files (below) uses the
   following records:

   (1) ID - either the 4-character PDB identifier code (where clean
   protein coordinate files are used as input) or the 7-character domain
   identifier code taken from scop (where domain coordinate files were
   used as input; see documentation for the EMBOSS application scope for
   further info.)

   (2) DE - bibliographic information. The text "Residue-residue contact
   data" is always given.

   (4) EX - experimental information. The value of the threshold contact
   distance is given as a floating point number after 'THRESH'. The
   number of models and number of polypeptide chains are given after
   'NMOD' and 'NCHA' respectively. domain coordinate files a 1 is always
   given. Following the EX record, the file will have a section
   containing a CN, IN and SM records (see below) for each chain. The
   sections for each chain of a model are given after the MO record.

   (5) MO - model number. The number given in brackets after this record
   indicates the start of a section of model-specific data.

   (6) CN - chain number. The number given in brackets after this record
   indicates the start of a section of chain-specific data.

   (7) IN - chain specific data. The character given after ID is the PDB
   chain identifier taken from the input file, (a '.` given in cases
   where a chain identifier was not specified in the original pdb file
   or, for domain coordinate files, the domain is comprised of more than
   one domain). The number of amino acid residues comprising the chain
   (or the chains from which a domain is comprised) is given after NR.
   The number of residue-residue contacts is given after NSMCON.

   (8) SM - Line of residue contact data. Pairs of amino acid identifiers
   and residue numbers are delimited by a ';'. Residue numbers are taken
   from the clean coordinate file and give a correct index into the
   sequence (i.e. they are not necessarily the same as the original pdb
   file).

   (9) XX - used for spacing.

   (10) // - given on the last line of the file only.

   Note - SM records are used for contacts between either either
   side-chain or main-chain atoms as defined above. In a future
   implementation, SS will be used for side-chain only contacts, MM will
   be used for main-chain only contacts, and there will probably be
   several other forms of contact too.

Data files

   contacts uses a data file containing van der Waals radii for atoms in
   proteins (below). The file Evdw.dat is such a data file and is part of
   the emboss distribution.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   contacts generates a log file an excerpt of which is shown (below). If
   there is a problem in processing a coordinate file, three lines
   containing the record '//', the scop domain or pdb identifier code and
   an error message respectively are written. The text 'WARN file open
   error filename', 'ERROR file read error filename' or 'ERROR file write
   error filename ' will be reported when an error was encountered during
   a file open, read or write respectively. Various other error messages
   may also be given (in case of difficulty email Jon Ison,
   jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   None. [an error occurred while processing this directive] A 'protein
   coordinate file' contains protein coordinate and other data extracted
   from a single pdb file. The files, generated by pdbparse, are in
   embl-like format and contain 'cleaned-up' data that is self-consistent
   and error-corrected.

   A 'domain coordinate file' contains coordinate and other data for a
   single scop domain. The files are generated by domainer and are in
   embl-like and pdb formats.

   siggen uses contacts files as input.
