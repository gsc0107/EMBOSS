Description

   This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly
   or indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and
   scop. This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline
   described in an accompanying document. We provide the software in the
   hope that it will be useful. The applications were designed for
   specific research purposes and may not be useful or reliable in
   contexts other than the described pipeline. The development of the
   suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to whom enquiries and bug reports
   should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).

   Some research applications require knowledge of the database
   sequence(s) that corresponds to the sequence(s) given in a pdb file. A
   'swissprot:pdb equivalence' file listing accession numbers and
   swissprot database identifiers for certain pdb code is available, but
   is not in a format that is consistent with flat file formats used for
   protein structural data in emboss. pdbtosp parses the swissprot:pdb
   equivalence in its raw format and converts it to an embl-like format.

   pdbtosp parses the swissprot:pdb equivalence table available at URL
   (1) (1) http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/lists?pdbtosp.txt and writes the
   data out in embl-like format file (Figure 2). The raw (input) file can
   be obtained by doing a "save as ... text format" from the web page
   (1). No changes are made to the data other than changing the format in
   which it is held. The input and output files are specified by the
   user.

Algorithm

   pdbtosp relies on finding a line beginning with '____ _' in the input
   file (all lines up to and including this one are ignored). Lines of
   code data are then parsed, up until the first blank line.

Input file format

   pdbtosp reads any normal sequence USAs.

Output file format

   An excerpt from the swissprot:pdb equivalence file in embl-like format
   is shown below. The records used to describe an entry are as follows.

   (1) EN - PDB identifier code. This is the 4-character PDB identifier
   code.

   (2) NE - Number of entries. This is the number of accession numbers
   that were given for that pdb code in the equivalence file.

   (3) IN - Code line. The swissprot database identifier code and
   accession number are given preceeding ID and ACC respectively.
