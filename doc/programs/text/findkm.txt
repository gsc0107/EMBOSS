Function

   Find Km and Vmax for an enzyme reaction by a Hanes/Woolf plot
   
Description

   Takes a file of enzymatic data and plots Michaelis Menten and Hanes
   Woolf plots of the data. From these it calculates the Michaelis Menten
   constant (Km) and the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the reaction.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with findkm
   

% findkm -graph cps 
Find Km and Vmax for an enzyme reaction by a Hanes/Woolf plot
Enter name of file containing data: ../../data/enztest.dat
Output file [enztest.findkm]:
