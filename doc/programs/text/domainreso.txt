1.0 SUMMARY

   Removes low resolution domains from a DCF file (domain classification
   file).

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   DOMAINRESO reads a DCF file and writes a DCF file containing the same
   domains excluding those whose resolution (Angstrom) of structure
   determination exceeds a user-defined threshold. The resolution data
   are taken from CCF (clean coordinate files) whose path and file
   extension (via the ACD file) are specified by the user. The names of
   the input and output files are also specified by the user.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation.

5.0 DATA FILES

   DOMAINRESO does not use any data files.

6.0 USAGE

  6.1 COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-cpdbpath]
   (Parameter 1) This option specifies the location of domain CCF file
   (clean coordinate files) (input). A 'clean cordinate file' contains
   coordinate and other data for a single PDB file or a single domain
   from SCOP or CATH, in CCF format (EMBL-like). The files, generated by
   using PDBPARSE (pdb files) or DOMAINER (domains), contain 'cleaned-up'
   data that is self-consistent and error-corrected. Records for residue
   solvent accessibility and secondary structure are added to the file by
   using PDBPLUS. Directory with files ./
   [-dcfin]
   (Parameter 2) This option specifies the name of DCF file (domain
   classification file) (input). A 'domain classification file' contains
   classification and other data for domains from SCOP or CATH, in DCF
   format (EMBL-like). The files are generated by using SCOPPARSE and
   CATHPARSE. Domain sequence information can be added to the file by
   using DOMAINSEQS. Input file Required
   -threshold This option specifies the threshold for inclusion
   (Angstroms). Domains exceeding the threshold for inclusion (Angstroms)
   will not be given in the output file. Any numeric value 2.8
   [-dcfout]
   (Parameter 3) This option specifies the name of DCF file (domain
   classification file) (output). A 'domain classification file' contains
   classification and other data for domains from SCOP or CATH, in DCF
   format (EMBL-like). The files are generated by using SCOPPARSE and
   CATHPARSE. Domain sequence information can be added to the file by
   using DOMAINSEQS. Output file test.scop
   Additional (Optional) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)

  6.2 EXAMPLE SESSION

   An example of interactive use of DOMAINRESO is shown below.

Unix % domainreso
Removes low resolution domains from a DCF file (domain classification file).
Location of domain clean coordinate files for input (DCF format input) [./]: /t
est_data
Name of domain classification file (DCF format input): /test_data/all.scop
Threshold for inclusion (Angstroms) [2.8]:
Name of domain classification file (DCF format output) [test.scop]: /test_data/
domainreso/all_2.3.scop
Unix %:

   The DCF file /test_data/all.scop was read and a DCF file called
   /test_data/domainreso/all_2.3.scop was written containing only those
   domains of 2.3 Angstrom resolution or better. Resolution data were
   taken from domain coordinte files in the directory /test_data.
   The following command line would achieve the same result.


domainreso /test_data /test_data/all.scop /test_data/domainreso/all_2.3.scop -t
hreshold 2.3

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   No known bugs.

8.0 NOTES

   Domains that lack a value for resolution in the CCF file (e.g.
   theoretical models and NMR structures) are included in the output
   file.

  8.1 GLOSSARY OF FILE TYPES

   FILE TYPE FORMAT DESCRIPTION CREATED BY SEE ALSO
   Domain classification file (for SCOP) DCF format (EMBL-like format for
   domain classification data). Classification and other data for domains
   from SCOP. SCOPPARSE Domain sequence information can be added to the
   file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   Domain classification file (for CATH) DCF format (EMBL-like format for
   domain classification data). Classification and other data for domains
   from CATH. CATHPARSE Domain sequence information can be added to the
   file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   Clean coordinate file (for domain) CCF format (EMBL-like format for
   protein coordinate and derived data). Coordinate and other data for a
   single domain from SCOP or CATH. The data are 'cleaned-up':
   self-consistent and error-corrected. DOMAINER Records for residue
   solvent accessibility and secondary structure are added to the file by
   using PDBPLUS.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   It is desirable to omit poor resolution protein structures when
   performing certain analyses of protein domains. DOMAINRESO reads a DCF
   file (domain classification file) and writes one containing the same
   domains excluding those whose resolution (Angstrom) of structure
   determination exceeds a user-defined threshold.

10.0 ALGORITHM

   None.

11.0 RELATED APPLICATIONS

   APPLICATION DESCRIPTION
   PDBPARSE Parses PDB files and writes CCF files (clean coordinate
   files) for proteins.
   DOMAINER Reads CCF files (clean coordinate files) for proteins and
   writes CCF files for domains in a DCF file (domain classification
   file).
   SCOPPARSE Reads raw SCOP classification files and writes a DCF file
   (domain classification file).
   CATHPARSE Reads raw CATH classification files and writes DCF file
   (domain classification file).
   DOMAINSEQS Adds sequence records to a DCF file (domain classification
   file).
   DOMAINNR Removes redundant domains from a DCF file (domain
   classification file).
   DOMAINREP Reorder DCF file (domain classification file) so that the
   representative structure of each user-specified node is given first.
   DOMAINALIGN Generates structure-based sequence alignments for nodes in
   a DCF file (domain classification file).
   SEQSEARCH Generate DHF files (domain hits files) of database hits
   (sequences) from a DAF file (domain alignment file) or other sequences
   by using PSI-BLAST.
   SEQWORDS Generates DHF files (domain hits files) of database hits
   (sequences) for nodes in a DCF file (domain classification file) by
   keyword search of UniProt.

12.0 DIAGNOSTIC ERROR MESSAGES

   None.
