Description

   This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly
   or indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and
   scop. This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline
   described in an accompanying document. We provide the software in the
   hope that it will be useful. The applications were designed for
   specific research purposes and may not be useful or reliable in
   contexts other than the described pipeline. The development of the
   suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to whom enquiries and bug reports
   should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).

   Some research applications require knowledge of the types of heterogen
   (non-protein groups) that are represented in pdb files. A dictionary
   of heterogen groups containing various data for all of the heterogens
   found in pdb is available, but is not in a format that is consistent
   with flat file formats used for protein structural data in emboss.
   hetparse parses the dictionary in its raw format and converts it to an
   embl-like format.

   hetparse parse the dictionary of heterogen groups available at
   http://pdb.rutgers.edu/het_dictionary.txt and writes a file containing
   the group names, synonyms and 3-letter codes in embl-like format.
   Optionally, hetparse will search a directory of pdb files and will
   count the number of files that each heterogen appears in. The path and
   extension for the pdb files and the names of the input and output
   files are user- specified.
