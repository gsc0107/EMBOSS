1.0 SUMMARY

   Generate database hits (sequences) to sequences by using PSI-BLAST.

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   SEQSEARCH reads a directory of i. single protein sequences or ii. set
   of protein sequences (aligned or unaligned) and generates a DHF file
   ('domain hits file') of sequence relatives (hits) for each file in the
   input directory. The hits are sequence relatives to the input
   sequences and are found by using PSIBLAST. Only unique hits are
   generated; only one of a set of identical hits returned by PSIBLAST is
   retained.
   Typically, aligned sequences within a DAF file ('domain alignment
   file') are input and the DHF file output is annotated with domain
   classification data.
   PSIBLAST must be installed on the system that is running SEQSEARCH
   (see 'Notes' below). The base name of an input file is used as the
   base name for the corresponding output file. The paths and extensions
   for the sequence files (input) and domain hits files (output) are
   specified by the user. The name of the BLAST-indexed database to
   search are also user-specified. A log file is also written.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the domain alignment file is described in DOMAINALIGN
   documentation.
   If other sequences or sequence sets (aligned or unaligned) are used as
   input, all of the common file formats are supported.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   SEQSEARCH generates a domain hits file in FASTA-like format (Figure
   1).
   Figure 1 DHF file (FASTA-like format)
   The file (Figure 1) contains two lines per hit. The first contains a
   description of the hit in 15 text tokens delimited by '^'. The tokens
   are as follows (a '.' is given where a token does not have a value):
   (i) Accession number of the hit.
   (ii) Database code from Uniprot.
   (iii - iv) Start and end positions of the hit relative to the full
   length sequence in the uniprot database (files of these type may also
   be generated by using SEQWORDS in which case a '.' will be given for
   these records - see SEQWORDS documentation ).
   (v) SCOP or CATH domain identifier code. This is a 7-character code
   that uniquely identifies the domain in SCOP or CATH.
   (vi) Domain identifier of the node. For example, if the domain
   alignment file was for a SCOP family, the SCOP Sunid for the family
   would be given. This number uniquely identifies the node (i.e. family
   in this case) in the raw SCOP or CATH parsable files.
   (vii) Domain class. Textual description of the 'Class' (SCOP and CATH
   domains).
   (viii) Domain architecture. Textual description of the 'Architecture'
   (CATH only).
   (ix) Domain topology. Textual description of the 'Topology' (CATH
   only).
   (x) Domain fold. Textual description of the 'Fold' (SCOP domains
   only).
   (xi) Domain superfamily. Textual description of the 'Superfamily'
   (SCOP and CATH domains).
   (xii) Domain family. Textual description of the 'Fold' (SCOP only).
   (xiii) Model type. The type of model that was used to generate the
   hit. May have a value of "PSIBLAST" (from PSIBLAST), "HMMER" (hidden
   Markov model from the HMMER package), "SAM" (hidden Markov model from
   the SAM package), SPARSE (sparse protein signature), HENIKOFF
   (Henikoff profile) or GRIBSKOV (Gribskov profile). A value of
   "PSIBLAST" is written by SEQSEARCH.
   (xiv) SC - Score of hit. A floating point value that is the score from
   psiblast (or other search algorithm).
   (xv) P-value of hit from search algorithm.
   (xvi) E-value of hit from search algorithm. The second line contains
   the protein sequence.

5.0 DATA FILES

   SEQSEARCH does not requires any data files.

6.0 USAGE

  6.1 COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -mode This option specifies the mode of SEQSEARCH operation. SEQSEARCH
   takes as input a directory of either i. single sequences, ii. set of
   sequences (unaligned or aligned, but typically aligned sequences
   within a domain alignment file)). The user has to specify which.
   1 (Single sequences)
   2 (Multiple sequences (e.g. sequence set or alignment))
   1
   [-inseqs]
   (Parameter 1) This option specifies the location of sequences, e.g.
   DAF files (domain alignment files) (input). SEQSEARCH takes as input a
   database of either i. single sequences, ii. sets of unaligned
   sequences or iii. sets of aligned sequences, e.g. a domain alignment
   file. A 'domain alignment file' contains a sequence alignment of
   domains belonging to the same SCOP or CATH family. The file is in
   clustal format annotated with domain family classification
   information. The files generated by using SCOPALIGN will contain a
   structure-based sequence alignment of domains of known structure only.
   Such alignments can be extended with sequence relatives (of unknown
   structure) by using SEQALIGN. Directory with files ./
   [-database]
   (Parameter 2) Name of BLAST-indexed database to search. Any string is
   accepted swissprot
   -niter This option specifies the number of PSIBLAST iterations. This
   option specifies the number of PSIBLAST iterations that are performed
   in a search. Any integer value 1
   -evalue This option specifies the threshold E-value for inclusion in
   family. This option specifies the threshold E-value for a PSIBLAST hit
   to be retained. Any numeric value 0.001
   -maxhits This option specifies the maximum number of hits. This option
   specifies the maximum number of PSIBLAST hit that are retained. It
   should normally be set high so that nothing is discarded. Any integer
   value 1000
   [-dhfout]
   (Parameter 3) This option specifies the location of DHF files (domain
   hits files) (output). A 'domain hits file' contains database hits
   (sequences) with domain classification information, in FASTA format.
   The hits are relatives to a SCOP or CATH family and are found from a
   search of a sequence database. Files containing hits retrieved by
   PSIBLAST are generated by using SEQSEARCH. Directory ./
   -logf This option specifies the name of log file for the build. The
   log file contains messages about any errors arising while SEQSEARCH
   ran. Output file seqsearch.log
   Additional (Optional) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)

Unix %

   All domain alignment files (with the file extension of .daf specified
   in the ACD file) were read from the directory /test_data; in this case
   two domain alignment files 54894.salign and 55074.salign were read.
   Sets of sequences extracted from these files were used to search the
   sequence database swissprot by using psiblast. psiblast was configured
   to perform 1 iteration with a threshold E-value for acceptance of a
   hit of 0.0001 and no more than 100 hits were generated from each
   iteration. Domain hits files were written to /test_data/seqsearch (
   the file extension .dhf was specified in the ACD file); in this case
   two files /test_data/54894.dhf and /test_data/55074.dhf were written.
   A log file called /test_data/seqsearch/seqsearch.log was also written.
   The following command line would achieve the same result.


seqsearch /test_data swissprot /test_data -niter 1 -evalue 0.0001 -maxhits 100
-mode 2 -omode 2 -logf /test_data/seqsearch.log

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   None.

8.0 NOTES

   1. Use of psiblast
   psiblast must be installed on the system that is running SEQSEARCH.
   When running SEQSEARCH at the HGMP it is essential that the command
   'use blast_v2' (which runs the script /packages/menu/USE/blast_v2) is
   given before it is run.
   SEQSEARCH requires a blast-indexed database to be present, i.e. both
   the sequence and index file must be present on the system. The name of
   the database to search specified in the acd file is that which is
   given as the -d parameter to blastpgp (e.g. blastpgp -d swissprot).

  8.1 GLOSSARY OF FILE TYPES

   FILE TYPE FORMAT DESCRIPTION CREATED BY SEE ALSO
   Domain hits file DHF format (FASTA-like format with domain
   classification information). Database hits (sequences) with domain
   classification information. The hits are relatives to a SCOP or CATH
   family and are found from a search of a sequence database. SEQSEARCH
   (hits retrieved by PSIBLAST) N.A.
   Domain alignment file DAF format (CLUSTAL-like format with domain
   classification information). Contains a sequence alignment of domains
   belonging to the same SCOP or CATH family. The file is annotated with
   domain family classification information. DOMAINALIGN (structure-based
   sequence alignment of domains of known structure). DOMAINALIGN
   alignments can be extended with sequence relatives (of unknown
   structure) to the family in question by using SEQALIGN.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   By using homology search tools such as blast it is possible to find
   relatives to a group of related proteins (family, superfamily etc),
   given one or more sequences belonging to the group of interest. For
   example, when using psiblast it is possible to use a sequence
   alignment as the seed with which to search a sequence database.
   Performing such searches for large datasets such as all families
   within SCOP or CATH potentially requires a lot of time for preparation
   of datasets, running jobs and so on, in addition to the compute time
   required for the searches themselves. SEQSEARCH automatically performs
   a psiblast search of a sequence database for each file in a directory
   of sequences or sets of sequences. These sequences are used for the
   searches. Typically, the directory contains DAF files (domain
   alignment files) and the alignments are for a certain node (e.g.
   family, superfamily etc) from SCOP or CATH.
