Function

   Wobble base plot
   
Description

   Wobble plots the third position variability as an indicator of a
   potential coding region.
   
   For each of the six possible translation frames, this plots a graph
   showing the percentage of 'G' and 'C' bases in the third position of
   codons in the frame within a window that is moved over the sequence.
   
   Bases other than 'G' and 'C' can be chosen with the -bases option.
   
   The Mean of the third base percentage value is drawn as a horizontal
   line across the plots.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with wobble. The example sequence is from
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has a high G+C content and a very biased
   third codon position (if it can be G or C, it usually is).

Diagnostic Error Messages

   "Sequence too short for window" - The sequence must be longer than 3
   times the window length.
   
   "Specifying ACG&T is meaningless" - When you use the option -bases to
   specify the bases to look for, it is pointless to specuy looking for
   all the possible bases as these should add to 100% all the time.
   
   "No bases specified" - Similarly you have to specify soem bases to
   look for otherwise you must plot a 0% line.
   
Exit status

   It always exist with a status of 0, unless a fatal error is given.
   
Known bugs

   None.
