1.0 SUMMARY

   Add records for residue solvent accessibility and secondary structure
   to a clean coordinate file.

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   pdbplus reads a directory of domain OR protein clean coordinate files
   and writes a directory containing the same files as the input
   directory but in which values for records for secondary structure and
   residue accessibility are given. These data are calculated by using
   the STRIDE and NACCESS programs and these must be installed on the
   system that is running PDBPLUS (see Section 8.0 below). PDBPLUS also
   requires a directory containing files in PDB format for each
   coordinate file in the input directory: either the original PDB file
   (for proteins) or files generated by using DOMAINER (for domains). The
   paths and extensions of the pdb (input) and coordinate (input and
   output) files are specified by the user. The names of the output
   coordinate files will be identical to those that are read.
   PDBPLUS generates 3 log files containing diagnostic messages for
   various problems encountered by PDBPARSE, STRIDE or NACCESS
   respectively (see Section 12.0 below).

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the clean coordinate file is described in the PDBPARSE
   documentation.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the clean coordinate file is described in PDBPARSE
   documentation.

5.0 DATA FILES

   PDBPLUS does not use a data file.

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   NACCESS and STRIDE do not always work as advertised owing, e.g. to
   arbitrary array limits in their code. If the derived data appears to
   be missing from the PDDBPARSE output this is probably

8.0 NOTES

   PDBPLUS requires a working version of NACCESS and STRIDE. When running
   PDBPLUS at the RFCGR it is essential that the commands 'use naccess'
   or 'use stride' (which run the scripts /packages/menu/USE/naccess and
   /packages/menu/USE/stride respectively) are given before it is run.

  8.1 DATA FILES

   FILE TYPE DESCRIPTION CREATED BY SEE ALSO
   Protein coordinate file Protein coordinate and other data for a single
   pdb file. File uses clean format. The 'cleaned-up' data is
   self-consistent and error-corrected. Records for residue solvent
   accessibility and secondary structure are added to the file by using
   PDBPLUS. PDBPARSE
   Domain coordinate file Coordinate and other data for a single domain
   from the SCOP or CATH databases. Tbe files are in clean and pdb
   formats. DOMAINER Records for residue solvent accessibility and
   secondary structure are added to the file by using PDBPLUS.
   Domain pdb file A pdb file for a domain DOMAINER N.A.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   PDBPLUS is a wrapper to the STRIDE [10] and NACCESS [11] programs that
   adds derived data (i - iv below) to a clean coordinate file. The
   values of the derived data for a given residue will of course depend
   on whether they were calculated from the coordinates for the entire
   structure or just the domain, i.e. whether PDBPLUS is provided with
   protein or domain clean coordinate files. Thus PDBPLUS provides useful
   flexibility in generating the derived data.
   i. Absolute (Abs.) and relative (Rel.) accessible surface area of
   residues according to NACCESS. Abs. is the summed accessible surface
   area of the atoms, whereas Rel. is expressed as a percentage relative
   to the accessibility of the atoms in an extended ALA-x-ALA tri-peptide
   conformation. The NACCESS authors treat alpha carbons as side-chain
   atoms so that glycine can have a value for side-chain accessible
   surface area (see 'Database format' below). They are therefore not
   included in the main-chain.
   ii. Phi and Psi angle and solvent accessible surface area of residues
   as calculated by using STRIDE.
   iii. Secondary structure assignment according to STRIDE, one of 'H'
   (alpha helix), 'G' (3-10 helix), 'I' (Pi-helix), 'E' (extended
   conformation), 'B' or 'b' (isolated bridge), 'T' (turn) or 'C' (coil,
   i.e. none of the above).
   iv. The number of helical or beta-strand secondary structure elements
   (SSEs) in the chain or domain. An 'element' is defined as a run of a
   user-defined number (typically 4) of residues in the 'H', 'G' or 'I'
   conformation (helices) or the 'E' conformation (beta-strands).

10.0 ALGORITHM

   Values in the clean coordinate file (see PDBPARSE documentation) for
   the number of helices (NH) or beta-strands (NE) in a chain and columns
   12-13 and 22-34 of the coordinate line record (CO) are given null
   values ('.' or 0) by PDBPARSE (see Section 4.0). PDBPLUS is used to
   assign values to these these records.

11.0 RELATED APPLICATIONS

   DOMAINER, CONTACTS, INTERFACE and FUNKY use protein coordinate files
   as input.

12.0 DIAGNOSTIC ERROR MESSAGES

   The following messages (in "quotes") may appear in the PDBPARSE log
   file (an explanation is given in parenethesis).
"clean coordinate file not found my.file" (a clean coordinate input file was no
t found for input)
"ERROR Clean coordinate file read error: my.file" (error in reading clean coord
inate file)
"no stride output for: my.file" (No STRIDE output was generated for my.file)
"stride output for: my.file" (STRIDE output *was* generated for my.file)
"no naccess output for:" (No NACCESS output was generated for my.file)
"naccess output for:" (NACCESS output *was* generated for my.file)
"PDB file not found: my.file" (a pdb file was not found for input)
"Could not write results file: my.file" (output file could not be written)
"Could not convert chain id A to chain number in pdb file my.file" (chain ident
ifier was not found in the clean coordinate file)
"STRIDE  failures: %12\nNACCESS failures: 123" (STRIDE failed for 12 pdb files
and NACCESS failed for 123 pdb files.  The clean coordinate files will lack the
 appropriate data (see Section 10.0).
