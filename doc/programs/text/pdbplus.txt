1.0 SUMMARY

   Add records for residue solvent accessibility and secondary structure
   to a CCF file (clean coordinate file).

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   PDBPLUS reads a directory of domain OR protein CCF files (clean
   coordinate files) and writes a directory containing the same files as
   the input directory but in which values for records for secondary
   structure and residue accessibility are given. These data are
   calculated by using the STRIDE and NACCESS programs and these must be
   installed on the system that is running PDBPLUS (see Section 8.0
   below). PDBPLUS also requires a directory containing files in PDB
   format for each coordinate file in the input directory: either the
   original PDB file (for proteins) or domain PDB files generated by
   using DOMAINER (for domains). The paths and extensions of the pdb
   (input) and coordinate (input and output) files are specified by the
   user (file extensions are given in the ACD file). The names of the
   output CCF files will be identical to those that are read.
   PDBPLUS generates 3 log files containing diagnostic messages for
   various problems encountered by PDBPARSE, STRIDE or NACCESS
   respectively (see Section 12.0 below).

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the CCF file is described in the PDBPARSE documentation.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the CCF file is described in the PDBPARSE documentation.

5.0 DATA FILES

   PDBPLUS does not use a data file.

6.0 USAGE

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-ccfin]
   (Parameter 1) This option specifies the location of CCF files (clean
   coordinate files) (input). A 'clean cordinate file' contains protein
   coordinate and derived data for a single PDB file ('protein clean
   coordinate file') or a single domain from SCOP or CATH ('domain clean
   coordinate file'), in CCF format (EMBL-like). The files, generated by
   using PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER (domains), contain 'cleaned-up'
   data that is self-consistent and error-corrected. Records for residue
   solvent accessibility and secondary structure are added to the file by
   using PDBPLUS. Directory with files ./
   [-pdbin]
   (Parameter 2) This option specifies the location of PDB files (input).
   A PDB file contains protein coordinate and other data. A detailed
   explanation of the PDB file format is available on the PDB web site
   http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/info.html Directory ./
   -pdbprefix This option specifies the file prefix of PDB files (if any)
   Any string is accepted An empty string is accepted
   -mode This option specifies the mode of operation.
   1 (Use STRIDE only)
   2 (Use NACCESS only)
   3 (Use STRIDE and NACCESS)

   -thresholdsize This option specifies the threshold size for SSEs
   (secondary structure elements) Any integer value 4
   [-ccfout]
   (Parameter 3) This option specifies the location of CCF files (clean
   coordinate files) (output). A 'clean cordinate file' contains protein
   coordinate and derived data for a single PDB file ('protein clean
   coordinate file') or a single domain from SCOP or CATH ('domain clean
   coordinate file'), in CCF format (EMBL-like). The files, generated by
   using PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER (domains), contain 'cleaned-up'
   data that is self-consistent and error-corrected. Records for residue
   solvent accessibility and secondary structure are added to the file by
   using PDBPLUS. Directory ./

   An example of interactive use of PDBPLUS is shown below.

   All CCF files were read from testdata/pdbplus/ccfin and CCF files
   (annotated with values for secondary structure and solvent
   accessibility) were written to testdata/pdbplus/ccfout. The STRIDE and
   NACCESS programs ran on PDB files within testdata/. Three log files
   (pdbplus.log, naccess.log and stride.log) were written. The threshold
   size for secondary structure elements was 4 residues. File extension
   of all input and output files would be set in the ACD file.
   The following command line would achieve the same result.


pdbplus testdata/pdbplus/ccfin testdata/ testdata/pdbplus/ccfout -pdbprefix ""
-mode 3 -thresholdsize 4 -errfile pdbplus.log -serrfile stride.log -nerrfile na
ccess.log

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   NACCESS and STRIDE do not always work as advertised owing, e.g. to
   arbitrary array limits in their code. If the derived data appears to
   be missing from the PDDBPARSE output this is probably why.

8.0 NOTES

   PDBPLUS requires a working version of NACCESS and STRIDE. When running
   PDBPLUS at the RFCGR it is essential that the commands 'use naccess'
   or 'use stride' (which run the scripts /packages/menu/USE/naccess and
   /packages/menu/USE/stride respectively) are given before it is run.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   PDBPLUS is a wrapper to the STRIDE [1] and NACCESS [2] programs that
   adds derived data (i - iv below) to a CCF file. The values of the
   derived data for a given residue will of course depend on whether they
   were calculated from the coordinates for the entire structure or just
   the domain, i.e. whether PDBPLUS is provided with protein or domain
   CCF files. Thus PDBPLUS provides useful flexibility in generating the
   derived data.
     * Absolute (Abs.) and relative (Rel.) accessible surface area of
       residues according to NACCESS. Abs. is the summed accessible
       surface area of the atoms, whereas Rel. is expressed as a
       percentage relative to the accessibility of the atoms in an
       extended ALA-x-ALA tri-peptide conformation. The NACCESS authors
       treat alpha carbons as side-chain atoms so that glycine can have a
       value for side-chain accessible surface area (see 'Database
       format' below). They are therefore not included in the main-chain.
     * Phi and Psi angle and solvent accessible surface area of residues
       as calculated by using STRIDE.
     * Secondary structure assignment according to STRIDE, one of 'H'
       (alpha helix), 'G' (3-10 helix), 'I' (Pi-helix), 'E' (extended
       conformation), 'B' or 'b' (isolated bridge), 'T' (turn) or 'C'
       (coil, i.e. none of the above).
     * The number of helical or beta-strand secondary structure elements
       (SSEs) in the chain or domain. An 'element' is defined as a run of
       a user-defined number (typically 4) of residues in the 'H', 'G' or
       'I' conformation (helices) or the 'E' conformation (beta-strands).

10.0 ALGORITHM

   Values in the CCF file for the number of helices (NH) or beta-strands
   (NE) in a chain and columns 12-13 and 22-34 of the coordinate line
   record (CO) are given null values ('.' or 0) by PDBPARSE (see Section
   4.0). PDBPLUS is used to assign values to these these records.

   APPLICATION DESCRIPTION
   PDBPARSE Parses PDB files and writes CCF files (clean coordinate
   files) for proteins.
   PDBPLUS Add residue solvent accessibility and secondary structure data
   to a CCF file (clean coordinate file) for a protein or domain.
   DOMAINER Reads CCF files (clean coordinate files) for proteins and
   writes CCF files for domains in a DCF file (domain classification
   file).
   CONTACTS Reads CCF files (clean coordinate files) and writes CON files
   (contact files) of intra-chain residue-residue contact data.
   INTERFACE Reads CCF files (clean coordinate files) and writes CON
   files (contact files) of inter-chain residue-residue contact data.
   SITES Reads CCF files (clean coordinate files) and writes CON files
   (contact files) of residue-ligand contact data for domains in a DCF
   file (domain classification file).

12.0 DIAGNOSTIC ERROR MESSAGES

   The following messages (in "quotes") may appear in the PDBPARSE log
   file (an explanation is given in parenethesis).
     * "clean coordinate file not found my.file" (a clean coordinate
       input file was not found for input)
     * "ERROR Clean coordinate file read error: my.file" (error in
       reading clean coordinate file)
     * "no stride output for: my.file" (No STRIDE output was generated
       for my.file)
     * "stride output for: my.file" (STRIDE output *was* generated for
       my.file)
     * "no naccess output for:" (No NACCESS output was generated for
       my.file)
     * "naccess output for:" (NACCESS output *was* generated for my.file)
     * "PDB file not found: my.file" (a pdb file was not found for input)
     * "Could not write results file: my.file" (output file could not be
       written)
     * "Could not convert chain id A to chain number in pdb file my.file"
       (chain identifier was not found in the clean coordinate file)
     * "STRIDE failures: %12\nNACCESS failures: 123" (STRIDE failed for
       12 pdb files and NACCESS failed for 123 pdb files. The clean
       coordinate files will lack the appropriate data (see Section
       10.0).
