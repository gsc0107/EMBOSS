Function

   Reports STOP codons and ORF statistics of a protein
   
Description

   Reads in a protein sequence containing stops, and writes a report of
   any open reading frames (continuous protein sequence with no stops)
   that are greater than a minimum size. The default minimum ORF size is
   100 residues. It writes out any ORF sequences.
   
   The input sequence might typically have been produced by transeq.
   
   Note that if you have only translated a nucleic sequence in one frame,
   checktrans will miss possible ORFs in other frames. You have to give
   checktrans translations in all three (six?) frames in order for it to
   be effective at finding all possible ORFs.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with checktrans
   

% checktrans 
Error: File /packages/emboss_dev/gwilliam/emboss/emboss/emboss/acd/checktrans.a
cd line 11: ../../data/paamir.pep
Expected ':' not found after 'min:1'
   
   Go to the input files for this example

Input file format

   This program reads the USA of a protein sequence with STOP codons in
   it.

Output file format

   This program writes three files: the ORF report file
   (paamir_1.checktrans), the output sequence file (paamir_1.fasta) and
   the feature file (paamir_1.out3) which is in GFF format by default.
   
   The ORF report file gives the numeric count of the ORF, the position
   of the terminating STOP codon, the length of the ORF, its start and
   end positions and the name of the sequence it has been written out as.
   
   The name of the output sequences is constructed from the name of the
   input sequence followed by an underscore and then the numeric count of
   the ORF (e.g. 'PAAMIR_1_7').
