1.0 SUMMARY

   [an error occurred while processing this directive]

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   Reads a DCF file (domain classification file) and a file of secondary
   structure (query) and writes DCF files containing the top-scoring
   matches (domains) between the query and domains from the DCF file. The
   secondary strructure file contains a (1) secondary structure element
   map (a string where each character represents a secondary structure
   element) and (2) a secondary structure string (each character
   represents an amino acid residue) for a given query. Matches are found
   by global alignment of (1) element maps and (2) strings (individual
   residues) to generate the two DCF (output) files.
   The DCF input file must contain domain secondary structure
   information, which can be added by using DOMAINSSE.
   The names of the secondary structure file, DCF files (input and
   output) and number of top-scoring matches to report are specified by
   the user. A log file is also written.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   Domain classification file
   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation.
   The DCF input file must contain domain secondary structure
   information, which can be added by using DOMAINSSE.
   Secondary structure file
   The format of the secondary structure file (Figure 1) is identical to
   the SS and SE records from a DCF file (see DOMAINSSE documentation.).
   The records are as follows:
     * (1) SS - Secondary structure assignment (per residue). A
       simplified 3-state assignment: H (helix), E (extended, beta
       strand) and L (loop, open coil) should be used.
     * (2) SE - Secondary structure element assignment (per secondary
       structure element). The same 3-state assignment as for the SS
       record should be used.

   Note that if the file contains secondary structure characters other
   than H, E and L they will be converted before they are used by
   SSEMATCH (see NOTES below).

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation. SSEMATCH adds an extra comment line at the top
   containing the score for the appropriate alignment (residue or

5.0 DATA FILES

   SSEMATCH requires a secondary structure substitution table such as
   SSSUB distributed with EMBOSS. An example (taken from Wallqvist et al)
   is shown in Figure 3.

  6.2 EXAMPLE SESSION

   An example of interactive use of SSEMATCH is shown below. Here is a
   sample session with ssematch


% ssematch 
Searches a DCF file (domain classification file) for secondary structure
matches.
Name of file of secondary structure (input).: sse.in
Name of DCF file (domain classification file) (input).: all_e.scop
Number of top-scoring matches to report. [5]: 1
Name of DCF file (domain classification file) containing top-scoring domains fo
r residue-based alinnment (output). [sse.ssematch]: res.dcf
Name of DCF file (domain classification file) containing top-scoring domains fo
r secondary structure element-based alinnment (output). [sse.out2]: elm.dcf
Name ssematch log file (output) [SSEMATCH.log]: 

   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

   Two strings (for residues and elements) of secondary structure were
   read from sse.in and scanned against all_e.scop. The single highest
   scoring match for each search was written to the output files: res.dcf
   for residue-based alignment and elm.dcf for element-based alignment. A
   log file called SSEMATCH.log was written.

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   The SSEMATCH implementation of secondary structure mapping is the most
   basic and more powerful algorithms are available. Input file
   The DCF input file must contain domain secondary structure
   information, which can be added by using DOMAINSSE.

8.0 NOTES

   Conversion of secondary structure file
   SSEMATCH currently only works with 3-state secondary structure
   assignments. The following conversions are applied to the characters
   in the secondary structure input file:
     * Bridge B/b, turn T, coil C are changed to 'L'.
     * Helices 'H', 'G', 'I' are changed to / remain 'H'.
     * Extended conformation ('E') remains 'E'.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   Secondary structure element mapping is a coarse but powerful approach
   for identifying similarities between protein sequences. SSEMATCH
   implements a very basic approach whereby a query sequence of secondary
   structure (of elements or residues) is scanned against a library of
   known secondary structures for domains in SCOP or CATH, as held in a
   DCF file (domain classification file).

10.0 ALGORITHM
