1.0 SUMMARY

   Adds sequence records to a DCF file

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   DOMAINSEQS parses a DCF file (domain classification file) and writes a
   file containing the same data, except that domain sequence information
   derived from structural and, optionally, sequence databases are added.
   Domain sequences are taken from domain CCF files (clean coordinate
   files) and (optionally) the swissprot database. If the swissprot
   sequence is used, DOMAINSEQS requires a swissprot:PDB equivalence file
   that gives the accession number of each PDB file corresponding to the
   domains in the DCF file. The path for the CCF files (input) and names
   of DCF files (input and output) are specified by the user. A log file
   is also written.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation.

5.0 DATA FILES

   If the user specified retrieval of sequences from a sequence database,
   DOMAINSEQS uses a swissprot:PDB equivalence file is generated by using
   PDBTOSP.

6.0 USAGE

  6.1 COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-dcfinfile]         infile     This option specifies the name of DCF file
                                  (domain classification file) (input). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
  [-dpdbdir]           directory  This option specifies the location of domain
                                  CCF file (clean coordinate files) (input).
                                  A 'clean cordinate file' contains coordinate
                                  and other data for a single PDB file or a
                                  single domain from SCOP or CATH, in CCF
                                  format (EMBL-like). The files, generated by
                                  using PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER
                                  (domains), contain 'cleaned-up' data that is
                                  self-consistent and error-corrected.
                                  Records for residue solvent accessibility
                                  and secondary structure are added to the
                                  file by using PDBPLUS.
   -getswiss           toggle     Retrieve swissprot sequence.
*  -pdbtospfile        infile     This option specifies the name of the
                                  pdbcodes to swissprot indexing file. The
                                  swissprot:PDB equivalence file is generated
                                  by PDBTOSP
  [-dcfoutfile]        outfile    This option specifies the name of DCF file
                                  (domain classification file) (output). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   -errfile            outfile    This option specifies the name of log file
                                  for the build. The log file contains
                                  messages about any errors arising while
                                  domainseqs ran.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
*  -datafile           matrixf    This option specifies the residue
                                  substitution matrix, which is used for
                                  sequence comparison.
*  -gapopen            float      This option specifies the gap insertion
                                  penalty. This is the score taken away when a
                                  gap is created. The best value depends on
                                  the choice of comparison matrix. The default
                                  value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62
                                  matrix for protein sequences, and the
                                  EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences.
*  -gapextend          float      This option specifies the gap extension
                                  penalty. This is added to the standard gap
                                  penalty for each base or residue in the gap.
                                  This is how long gaps are penalized.
                                  Usually you will expect a few long gaps
                                  rather than many short gaps, so the gap
                                  extension penalty should be lower than the
                                  gap penalty.

  6.2 EXAMPLE SESSION

   An example of interactive use of DOMAINSEQS is shown below.
   The DCF file (domain classification file) lacking sequence information
   called /test_data/all.scop was parsed and a DCF file with sequence
   information called /test_data/domainseqs/all_s.scop was written. The
   file Epdbtosp.dat was queried for accession numbers of PDB files
   corresponding to the domains in all.scop, but no accession numbers
   were found for either of the domains d1ii7a_ or d1cs4a_. A log file
   called /test_data/domainseqs/domainseqs.log was written.

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   The swissprot:PDB equivalence file available as part of the EMBOSS
   distribution does not contain accession numbers for all PDB files and
   covers only a relatively small proportion of domains in SCOP.

8.0 NOTES

   DOMAINSEQS will not attempt to retrieve a swissprot sequence for any
   domains comprised of more than a single segment, i.e. for domains
   whose NC record in the DCF file has a value other than 1 (see
   SCOPPARSE documentation).
   The region of sequence to retrieve is identified by alignment of the
   sequence from the CCF file (structural database) to the full length
   sequences in swissprot. If this were to be done for segmented domains,
   the start and end point for the retrieved sequence (relative to the
   full length sequence) might actually include a completely different
   domain.
   Consider :
   (A) represents a sequence from the coordinate file for a segmented
   domain D1
   (B) represents the full-length swissprot sequence, it includes D1, but
   D1 is split by a second domain D2

                 D1
  (A)  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

          D1         D2        D1
  (B) XXXXXXXXXX-----------XXXXXXXXXXX

   It should be clear that for an alignment retrieving B, the start and
   end points for the retrieved sequence would be misleading.
   The user should be aware that sequences from the domain CCF file for
   domains comprised of more than a single segment are not biologically
   significant, as the sequences are derived from different segments of
   one or more chains. However, such sequences might be acceptable for
   redundancy calculations (e.g. by using DOMAINNR) because two redundant
   domains made of similar fragments will have similar sequences, so the
   redundancy should be detectable.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   Domain sequences are not given in the raw SCOP or CATH parsable files,
   but are required for many analyses and for convenience should,
   ideally, be provided along with the classification itself. DOMAINSEQS
   reads a DCF file (domain classificaiton file) that lacks sequence
   information and writes one containing sequence information.

10.0 ALGORITHM

   In order to find the start and end of a domain in a sequence from
   swissprot, the domain sequence from the domain CCF file is aligned to
   the full length protein sequence from swissprot. Alignment is
   performed first by string handling and if that fails, by using the
   EMBOSS implementation of the Needleman and Wunsch global alignment
   algorithm. Gap insertion and extension penalties used in the
   alignments are user-specified.
