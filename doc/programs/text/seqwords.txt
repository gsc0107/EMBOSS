Usage

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-keyfile]           infile     This option specifies the name of keywords
                                  file (input). This contains a list of
                                  keywords specific to a number of SCOP or
                                  CATH families and superfamilies used by
                                  SEQWORDS to search a sequence database.
  [-spfile]            infile     This option specifies the name of the
                                  sequence database (input) to search.
  [-outfile]           outfile    This option specifies the name of the DHF
                                  file (domain hits file) (output). A 'domain
                                  hits file' contains database hits
                                  (sequences) with domain classification
                                  information, in the DHF format (FASTA-like).
                                  The hits are relatives to a SCOP or CATH
                                  family (or other node in the structural
                                  hierarchies) and are found from a search of
                                  a sequence database. Files containing hits
                                  retrieved by PSIBLAST are generated by using
                                  SEQSEARCH, hits retrieved by a sparse
                                  protein signatare by using SIGSCAN or
                                  various types of HMM and profile by using
                                  LIBSCAN.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers: (none)
   Associated qualifiers:

   "-outfile" associated qualifiers
   -odirectory3        string     Output directory

   General qualifiers:
   -auto               boolean    Turn off prompts
   -stdout             boolean    Write standard output
   -filter             boolean    Read standard input, write standard output
   -options            boolean    Prompt for standard and additional values
   -debug              boolean    Write debug output to program.dbg
   -verbose            boolean    Report some/full command line options
   -help               boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose

   -die                boolean    Report deaths


   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-keyfile]
   (Parameter 1) This option specifies the name of keywords file (input).
   This contains a list of keywords specific to a number of SCOP or CATH
   families and superfamilies used by SEQWORDS to search a sequence
   database. Input file Required
   [-spfile]
   (Parameter 2) This option specifies the name of the sequence database
   (input) to search. Input file Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 3) This option specifies the name of the DHF file (domain
   hits file) (output). A 'domain hits file' contains database hits
   (sequences) with domain classification information, in the DHF format
   (FASTA-like). The hits are relatives to a SCOP or CATH family (or
   other node in the structural hierarchies) and are found from a search
   of a sequence database. Files containing hits retrieved by PSIBLAST
   are generated by using SEQSEARCH, hits retrieved by a sparse protein
   signatare by using SIGSCAN or various types of HMM and profile by
   using LIBSCAN. Output file test.hits
