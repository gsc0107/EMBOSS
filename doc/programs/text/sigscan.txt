Usage

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sigin]             infile     A 'signature file' contains a sparse
                                  sequence signature. The files are generated
                                  by siggen.
  [-database]          seqall     Sequence database USA
   -thresh             integer    Minimum length (residues) of overlap
                                  required for two hits with the same code to
                                  be counted as the same hit.
   -sub                matrixf    Residue substitution matrix
   -gapo               float      The gap insertion penalty is the score taken
                                  away when a gap is created. The best value
                                  depends on the choice of comparison matrix.
                                  The default value assumes you are using the
                                  EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, and
                                  the EDNAMAT matrix for nucleotide sequences.
   -gape               float      The gap extension, penalty is added to the
                                  standard gap penalty for each base or
                                  residue in the gap. This is how long gaps
                                  are penalized. Usually you will expect a few
                                  long gaps rather than many short gaps, so
                                  the gap extension penalty should be lower
                                  than the gap penalty. An exception is where
                                  one or both sequences are single reads with
                                  possible sequencing errors in which case you
                                  would expect many single base gaps. You can
                                  get this result by setting the gap open
                                  penalty to zero (or very low) and using the
                                  gap extension penalty to control gap
                                  scoring.

                                  profile or Hennikoff profile) against a
                                  sequence database. The files are generated
                                  by sigscan and modelscan.
  [-alignf]            outfile    A 'signature alignment file' contains the
                                  alignments resulting from a search of a
                                  sparse protein signature against a sequence
                                  database. The files are generated by
                                  sigscan.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:

                                  different scop families, superfamilies and
                                  folds. The file contains the collated
                                  results from psiblast searches of a sequence
                                  database for the indvidual scop families;
                                  hits of unambiguous family assignment are
                                  listed under their respective family,
                                  otherwise a hit is assigned as relatives to
                                  a scop superfamily or fold instead. The scop
                                  validation file is generated by seqnr and
                                  is in embl-like format.
