   as the window is moved along the sequence.

Output file format

   If the option '-plot' is specified then charge displays a graph of the
   charge along the sequence otherwise it writes out a file containing
   the charges within a window starting at each position along the
   sequence.
   
   The output file contains two columns separated by space or TAB
   characters. The first column is the position of the start of the
   window. The second column is the charge of the amino acids within that
   window.
   
  Output files for usage example

Data files

   charge reads the data file 'Eamino.dat' to find the charge of the
   amino acids in the protein.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
   
% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
