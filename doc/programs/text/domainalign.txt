1.0 SUMMARY

   Generates structure-based sequence alignments for nodes in a DCF file
   (domain classification file).

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   DOMAINALIGN reads a DCF file (domain classification file) and
   generates a structure-based sequence alignment annotated with domain
   classification data ('domain alignment file') for each user-defined
   node (e.g. family or superfamily) in the DCF file in turn. If the
   STAMP algorithm is used, structural superimpositions are also
   generated and saved to file (PDB format). The alignments are
   calculated by using stamp or TCOFFEE and these applications must be
   installed on the system that is running DOMAINALIGN (see 'Notes'
   below).
   Clearly no alignment can be generated for nodes with a single entry
   (domain) only: sequences for such domains are (optionally) written to
   file (fasta format).
   DOMAINALIGN requires a directory of domain PDB files; the path and
   extension of these must be set by the user (via the ACD file) and also
   specified in the stamp "pdb.directories" file (see 'Notes' below)
   A log file of diagnostic messages is written. The identifier (e.g SCOP
   Sunid) of the nodes from the DCF file are used to name the output
   files. The user also specifies the input file, paths for the two types
   of alignment files (output), path of singlet sequence files (if
   output) and name of log file.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the domain classification file is described in
   scopparse.c

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   Structure-based sequence alignment 
   This file (Figure 1) is in EMBOSS "simple" multiple sequence alignment
   format. This is similar to the output file generated by stamp when
   issued with the following three types of command:

 (1) stamp -l ./stamps_file.dom -s -n 2 -slide 5 -prefix ./stamps_file -d
 ./stamps_file.set;sorttrans -f ./stamps_file.scan -s Sc 2.5 >
 ./stamps_file.sort;stamp -l ./stamps_file.sort -prefix ./stamps_file >
 ./stamps_file.log

 (2) poststamp -f ./stamps_file.3 -min 0.5

 (3) ver2hor -f ./stamps_file.3.post > ./stamps_file.out

   The DOMAINALIGN output file (Figure 1) displays the sequence names,
   positions and sequences. The names are the 7 character domain
   identifier codes taken from the domain classification file. The
   positions are the start and end residue positions of the appropriate
   section of sequence. The sequence uses '-' as a gap character. The
   domain classification records for the appopriate node from the DCF
   file are given above the alignment. The STAMP 'Post similar' line is
   given as a markup line underneath the sequence but no dssp assignments
   are written. All lines other than sequence lines begin with '#' to
   denote a comment.

   Structural superimposition 
   A structural superimposition is generated if the STAMP algorithm is
   selected. PDB format is used for the DOMAINALIGN structure alignment
   (superposition) output file (Figure 2). This is unmodified stamp
   output. A detailed explanation of the PDB file format is available on
   the PDB web site:
   http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/info.html#File_Formats_and_Standards

5.0 DATA FILES

   DOMAINALIGN does not use any data files but uses the stamp
   "pdb.directories" file which specifies the permissible prefix,
   extension and path of PDB files used by STAMP. On the RFCGR system,
   this file is /packages/stamp/defs/pdb.directories and should look like
   :

 test_data/ - .dent
 /data/pdb - -
 /data/pdb _ .ent
 /data/pdb _ .pdb
 /data/pdb pdb .ent
 /data/pdbscop _ _
 /data/pdbscop _ .ent

6.0 USAGE

  6.1 COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-dcfin]
   (Parameter 1) This option specifies the name of DCF file (domain
   classification file) (input). A 'domain classification file' contains
   classification and other data for domains from SCOP or CATH, in DCF
   format (EMBL-like). The files are generated by using SCOPPARSE and
   CATHPARSE. Domain sequence information can be added to the file by
   using DOMAINSEQS. Input file Required
   [-pdb]
   (Parameter 2) This option specifies the location of domain PDB files
   (input). A 'domain PDB file' contains coordinate data for a single
   domain from SCOP or CATH, in PDB format. The files are generated by
   using DOMAINER. Directory ./
   -node This option specifies the node for redundancy removal.
   Redundancy can be removed at any specified node in the SCOP or CATH
   hierarchies. For example by selecting 'Class' entries belonging to the
   same Class will be non-redundant.
   1 (Class (SCOP))
   2 (Fold (SCOP))

   4 (Family (SCOP))
   5 (Class (CATH))
   6 (Architecture (CATH))
   7 (Topology (CATH))
   8 (Homologous Superfamily (CATH))
   9 (Family (CATH))
   1
   -mode This option specifies the alignment algorithm to use.
   1 (STAMP)
   2 (TCOFFEE)
   1
   -keepsinglets This option specifies whether to write sequences of
   singlet families to file. If you specify this option, the sequence for
   each singlet family are written to file (output). Toggle value Yes/No
   Y
   -singlets This option specifies the location of DHF files (domain hits
   files) for singlet sequences (output). The singlets are written out as
   a 'domain hits file' - which contains database hits (sequences) with
   domain classification information, in FASTA format. Directory
   [-daf]
   (Parameter 3) This option specifies the location of DAF files (domain
   alignment files) (output). A 'domain alignment file' contains a
   sequence alignment of domains belonging to the same SCOP or CATH
   family. The files are in clustal format and are annotated with domain
   family classification information. The files generated by using
   SCOPALIGN will contain a structure-based sequence alignment of domains
   of known structure only. Such alignments can be extended with sequence
   relatives (of unknown structure) by using SEQALIGN. Directory ./
   -super This option specifies the location of structural
   superimposition files (output). A file in PDB format of the structural
   superimposition is generated for each family if the STAMP algorithm is
   used. Directory ./
   -logf This option specifies the name of log file (output). The log
   file contains messages about any errors arising while domainalign ran.
   Output file domainalign.log

   Two alignments each of two domains were performed (by using STAMP).
   Structure-based sequence alignments (/test_data/55074.daf and
   /test_data/54894.daf) and structure alignments (55074.ent and
   54894.ent) were written. The file extensions were specified by the
   user in the ACD file. The base name of these files (55074 and 54894)
   is the same as the Sunid for the node (family in this case) taken from
   the domain classification file /test_data/all.scop2. Any sequences of
   singlet families were written to /test_data/domainalign. A log file
   called domainalign.logf was written to /test_data/domainalign.
   The following command line would achieve the same result.


 domainalign /test_data/all.scop2 /test_data/ /test_data/ /test_data/domainalig

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   1. Use of stamp
   DOMAINALIGN requires a modified version of stamp (see Notes below).
   The modified stamp application must be installed on the system that is
   running DOMAINALIGN.
   When running DOMAINALIGN at the RFCGR, to ensure the modified version
   of stamp is used, type 'use stamp2' (which runs the script
   /packages/menu/USE/stamp2) before DOMAINALIGN is run.
   2. Strange stamp behaviour
   stamp will ignore (omit from the alignment and *not* replace with '-'
   or any other symbol) ANY residues or groups in a PDB file that
   (i) are not structured (i.e. do not appear in the ATOM records) or
   (ii) lack a CA atom, regardless of whether it is a known amino acid or
   not.
   This means that the position (column) in the alignment cannot reliably
   be used as the basis for an index into arrays representing the full
   length sequences. stamp will however include in the alignment residues
   with a single atom only, so long as it is the CA atom.
   3. Handling of singlet nodes
   No sequence alignment or structural superimposition files are
   generated for nodes that contain a single domain only. Sequences for
   such domains can be saved to file (see 2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS).
   4. Alignment numbering
   Residue number positions in alignment are not implemented (zero's are
   given).

8.0 NOTES

   1. Adaption of STAMP for domain codes
   DOMAINALIGN will only run with with a version of stamp which has been
   modified so that PDB id codes of length greater than 4 characters are
   acceptable. This involves a trivial change to the stamp module
   getdomain.c (around line number 155), a 4 must be changed to a 7 as
   follows:

 temp=getfile(domain[0].id,dirfile,4,OUTPUT);
 temp=getfile(domain[0].id,dirfile,7,OUTPUT);

   2. Adaption of STAMP for larger datasets
   STAMP fails to align a large dataset of all the available V set Ig
   domains. The ver2hor module generates the following error:

 error: something wrong with STAMP file
          STAMP length is 370, Alignment length is 422
          STAMP nseq is 155, Alignment nseq is 155

   This is fixed by the following change in alignfit.h.

#define MAXtlen 200
#define MAXtlen 2000

   At the same time the following may be changed as a safety measure:

 gstamp.c  : #define MAX_SEQ_LEN 10000    (was 2000)
 pdbseq.c  : #define MAX_SEQ_LEN 10000    (was 3000)
 defaults.h: #define MAX_SEQ_LEN 10000    (was 8000)
 defaults.h: #define MAX_NSEQ 10000       (was 1000)
 defaults.h: #define MAX_BLOC_SEQ 5000    (was 500)
 dstamp.h  : #define MAX_N_SEQ 10000      (was 1000)
 ver2hor.h : #define MAX_N_SEQ 10000      (was 1000)

   The modified code (for 2. and 3. above) is kept on the HGMP file
   system in /packages/stamp/src2
   WHEN RUNNING DOMAINALIGN AT THE HGMP IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE COMMAND
   'use stamp2' (which runs the script /packages/menu/USE/stamp2) IS
   GIVEN BEFORE DOMAINALIGN IS RUN. 
   This will ensure that the modified version of stamp is used.
   3. pdb.directories file
   stamp (and therefore DOMAINALIGN) uses a "pdb.directories" file: see
   5.0 DATA FILES 
   4. Choice of alignment algorithm
   Future versions of DOMAINALIGN will implement a larger choice of
   alignment algorithms.
   5. Getting the best alignment
   DOMAINALIGN will produce better alignments if the DCF file is
   reordered so that the representative structure of each node (e.g.
   family) is given first. This is achieved by using DOMAINREP.
   6. Whitespace in alignment
   STAMP can insert non-sensical whitespaces into its alignments, e.g.
   instead of a residue character where that residue was missing electron
   density in the PDB file. DOMAINALIGN replaces each whitespace within a
   STAMP alignment with an "X".

  8.1 GLOSSARY OF FILE TYPES

   FILE TYPE FORMAT DESCRIPTION CREATED BY SEE ALSO
   Domain classification file (for SCOP) DCF format (EMBL-like format for
   domain classification data). Classification and other data for domains
   from SCOP. SCOPPARSE Domain sequence information can be added to the
   file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   Domain classification file (for CATH) DCF format (EMBL-like format for
   domain classification data). Classification and other data for domains
   from CATH. CATHPARSE Domain sequence information can be added to the
   file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   Domain PDB file PDB format for domain coordinate data. Coordinate data
   for a single domain from SCOP or CATH. DOMAINER N.A.
   Domain alignment file DAF format (clustal format with domain
   classification information). Contains a sequence alignment of domains
   belonging to the same SCOP or CATH family. The file is annotated with
   domain family classification information. DOMAINALIGN (structure-based
   sequence alignment of domains of known structure). DOMAINALIGN
   alignments can be extended with sequence relatives (of unknown
   structure) to the family in question by using SEQALIGN.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   The generation of alignments for large datasets such as SCOP and CATH
   potentially requires a lot of time for preparation of datasets,
   writing of scripts, running individual jobs and so on, in addition to
   the compute time required for the alignments themselves. DOMAINALIGN
   automates this process: it reads a domain classification file and
   generates alignments for each user-specified node in turn.

   APPLICATION DESCRIPTION
   SCOPPARSE Reads raw SCOP classification files and writes a DCF file
   (domain classification file).
   CATHPARSE Reads raw CATH classification files and writes DCF file
   (domain classification file).
   DOMAINRESO Removes low resolution domains from a DCF file (domain
   classification file).
   DOMAINSEQS Adds sequence records to a DCF file (domain classification
   file).
   DOMAINNR Removes redundant domains from a DCF file (domain
   classification file). The file must contain domain sequence
   information, which can be added by using DOMAINSEQS.
   DOMAINREP Reorder DCF file (domain classification file) so that the
   representative structure of each user-specified node is given first.

12.0 DIAGNOSTIC ERROR MESSAGES

   The following message may appear in the log file.
   Replaced ' ' in STAMP alignment with 'X' (STAMP can insert
   non-sensical whitespaces into its alignments, e.g. instead of a
   residue character where that residue was missing electron density in
   the PDB file. DOMAINALIGN replaces each whitespace within a STAMP
   alignment with an "X").
