2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   DOMAINSSE parses a DCF file (domain classification file) and writes a
   file containing the same data, except that domain secondary structure
   information derived from structural are added. Domain sequences are
   taken from domain CCF files (clean coordinate files). The CCF files
   must contain secondary structure information, which can be added by
   using PDBPLUS. The path for the CCF files (input) and names of DCF
   files (input and output) are specified by the user. The extension of
   CCF files is specified in the ACD file. A log file is also written.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation. DOMAINRESO adds the following records:
     * (1) SS - Secondary structure assignment (per residue). A
       simplified 3-state assignment: H (helix), E (extended, beta
       strand) and L (loop, open coil) is used.
     * (2) SE - Secondary structure element assignment (per secondary
       structure element). The same 3-state assignment as for the SS
       record is used: H (helix), E (extended, beta strand) and L (loop,
       open coil).

  6.2 EXAMPLE SESSION

   An example of interactive use of DOMAINSSE is shown below. Here is a
   sample session with domainsse


% domainsse 
Adds secondary structure records to a DCF file (domain classification
file).

   Go to the output files for this example

   The DCF file (domain classification file) lacking secondary structure
   information called /test_data/all.scop was parsed and a DCF file with
   secondary structure information called
   /test_data/domainseqs/all_s.scop was written. Secondary structure
   information was taken from CCF files in test_data/. A log file called
   /test_data/domainseqs/DOMAINSSE.log was written.

   FILE TYPE FORMAT DESCRIPTION CREATED BY SEE ALSO
   Domain classification file (for SCOP) DCF format (EMBL-like format for
   domain classification data). Classification and other data for domains

   file by using DOMAINSEQS.

   domain classification data). Classification and other data for domains
   from CATH. CATHPARSE Domain sequence information can be added to the
   file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   Clean coordinate file (for protein) CCF format (EMBL-like format for
   protein coordinate and derived data). Coordinate and other data for a
   single PDB file. The data are 'cleaned-up': self-consistent and
   error-corrected. PDBPARSE Records for residue solvent accessibility
   and secondary structure are added to the file by using PDBPLUS.
   Clean coordinate file (for domain) CCF format (EMBL-like format for
   protein coordinate and derived data). Coordinate and other data for a
   single domain from SCOP or CATH. The data are 'cleaned-up':
   self-consistent and error-corrected. DOMAINER Records for residue
   solvent accessibility and secondary structure are added to the file by
   using PDBPLUS.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   Domain secondary structure information is not given in the raw SCOP or
   CATH parsable files, but is required for many analyses and for
   convenience should, ideally, be provided along with the classification
   itself. DOMAINSSE reads a DCF file (domain classificaiton file) that
   lacks secondary structure information and writes one containing such
   information.
