    Function

Reads CCF files (clean coordinate files) and writes CON files (contact files) of inter-chain residue-residue contact data

<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
  -->

This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly or
indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and scop.
This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline described in an
accompanying document.  We provide the software in the hope that it will
be useful.  The applications were designed for specific research purposes
and may not be useful or reliable in contexts other than the described
pipeline.  The development of the suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to
whom enquiries and bug reports should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).

<p>

Knowledge of the physical contacts that amino acid residues in two
different polypeptide chains of a protein make with one another is
required for several different analyses.  interface calculates inter-chain
residue-residue contact data from clean protein coordinate files.

<p>

interface reads a protein coordinate file and writes a file of inter-chain
residue-residue contact data in embl-like format.  The file contains
residue contact data for all pairs of chains in each model in the
coordinate file.  The input and output files are specified by the user.  A
log file is also written.     












<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

<!-- 
        Algorithms
	  Pseudocode/Vague description/Handwaving/web links to useful pages
  -->

Contact between two residues is defined as when the van der Waals surface
of any atom of the first residue comes within the threshold contact
distance of the van der Waals surface of any atom of the second residue.
The threshold contact distance is a user-defined distance with a default
value of 1 Angstrom. 












<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

                                  (input). A 'clean cordinate file' contains
                                  protein coordinate and derived data for a

                                  format (EMBL-like). The files, generated by

                                  (domains), contain 'cleaned-up' data that is
                                  self-consistent and error-corrected.

                                  distance. Contact between two residues is
                                  defined as when the van der Waals surface of
                                  any atom of the first residue comes within

                                  residue. The threshold contact distance is a
                                  user-defined distance with a default value
                                  of 1 Angstrom.

                                  (contact file) (output). A 'contact file'
                                  contains contact data for a protein or a
                                  domain from SCOP or CATH, in the CON format
                                  (EMBL-like). The contacts may be intra-chain
                                  residue-residue, inter-chain
                                  residue-residue or residue-ligand. The files
                                  are generated by using CONTACTS, INTERFACE
                                  and FUNKY.

                                  file for the build. The log file contains
                                  messages about any errors arising while
                                  INTERFACE ran.

                                  with van der Waals radii. The file of van
                                  der Waals radii for atoms in amino acid
                                  residues is part of the emboss distribution.
   -ignore             float      This option specifies the threshold ignore
                                  distance. If any two atoms from two
                                  different residues are at least this

<p>



<p>

The embl-like format used for the contact files (below) uses the following
records:

<p>

(1)  ID - the 4-character PDB identifier code.

<p>

(2)  DE - bibliographic information.  The text "Residue-residue contact
data" is always given.

<p>

(3)  EX - experimental information. The value of the threshold contact
distance is given as a floating point number after 'THRESH'. The number of
models and number of polypeptide chains are given after 'NMOD' and 'NCHA'
respectively. domain coordinate files a 1 is always given. Following the EX
record, the file will have a section containing a PA, IN and SM records
(see below) for each chain pair. The sections for each chain pair of a model
are given after the MO record.

<p>

(4) MO - model number. The number given in brackets after this record
indicates the start of a section of model-specific data.

<p>

(5) PA - chain pair number.  The numbers given either side of the ':' after
this record indicate the start of a section of chain pair-specific data.

<p>

(6) IN - chain specific data. The characters
given after ID1 and ID2 are the PDB chain identifiers for the pair taken
from the input file, (a '.`
given in cases where a chain identifier was not specified in the original
pdb file). The number of amino acid residues comprising each chain is given
after NR1 and NR2 respectively. The number of residue-residue contacts is
given after NSMCON.

<p>

(7) SM - Line of residue contact data. Pairs of amino acid identifiers and
residue numbers are delimited by a ';'. Residue numbers are taken from the
clean coordinate file and give a correct index into the sequence (i.e. they
are not necessarily the same as the original pdb file).  The first residue
belongs to the first partner of the chain-pair, the second residue belongs
to the second partner.

<p>

(8) XX - used for spacing.

<p>

(9) // - given on the last line of the file only.

<p>

Note - SM records are used for contacts between either either side-chain
or main-chain atoms as defined above.  In a future implementation, SS will
be used for side-chain only contacts, MM will be used for main-chain only
contacts, and there will probably be several other forms of contact too.

        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>

contacts uses a data file containing van der Waals radii for atoms in
proteins.  The file Evdw.dat is such a data file and is part
of the emboss distribution.
