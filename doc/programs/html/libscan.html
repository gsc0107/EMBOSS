    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
  -->

Scans each signature, profile or HMM in a directory against a sequence
database and writes a signature hits file for each one. Or scans sequences
against such a library of discriminating elements and writes a library scan
file for each one. 

<p>

This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly or
indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and scop.
This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline described in an
accompanying document.  We provide the software in the hope that it will
be useful.  The applications were designed for specific research purposes
and may not be useful or reliable in contexts other than the described
pipeline.  The development of the suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to
whom enquiries and bug reports should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).

<p>

The advantage of screening a relatively small library of discriminating
elements with a sequence is that it is sufficient for the sequence to
detect its true family (discriminator) in the first rank for an effective
prediction.  This is in contrast to searching a larger sequence database to
identify homology, where biologically significant hits may achieve
statistically insignificant scores and therefore be missed.  A library
might help the detection of such proteins because they may still score
their true discriminator higher than the others in the library regardless
of statistical estimates.  Further improvements to predictions are gained
when multiple sources of evidence, in this case the different types of
discriminating element, are considered.

<p>

The libscan application allows a protein sequence or sequences to be
screened against the library of discriminating elements.  The results of a
screen are returned to the user in a library scan file containing a list
of top-scoring SCOP domains rank-ordered by p-value for each individual
type of discriminator, and also for all of the discriminator types in
combination (combined prediction).  For the combined prediction, the
p-value is derived from an empirically derived distribution of the product
of the p-values of the individual methods.    

<p>

libscan runs in one of two modes either (i) database search mode or (ii)
library screen mode. In database search mode libscan reads one or more
directories each containing a single type of discriminating element, the
permitted types are sparse sequence signature, Gribskov profile, Henikoff
profile or hidden Markov model.  Each directory must contain a
discriminating element for each of one or more scop families; files for
indivdual families should have the same name (possibly with different file
extensions) in the different directories, e.g. the scop family with the
identifier 46445 might be represented by files 46445.hmm, 46445.sig,
46445.gribs and 46445.henik in their respective directories.  libscan scans
each discriminating element against a sequence set that must also be
provided by the user and generates a signature hits file (of scored hits
to sequences in the set) for each individual discriminating element.  In
mode (i), the user must also provide a scop validation file so that a
classification of hits can be given in the signature hits files.  The user
specifies a maximum number of false hits that are written to the signature
hits files.

<p>

In library screen mode, libscan
reads a sequence set, screens each sequence against the library
(directories of discriminating elements) and writes a library scan file
(of top-scoring families) for each sequence.  In either mode, a scop
classification file is required as a source of family classification data.
The paths and extensions of the sequence set and scop classification files
(input) different types of discriminating elements (input), and paths and
extension of signature hits files or library scan file (output) are
specified by the user.       












<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

<!-- 
        Algorithms
	  Pseudocode/Vague description/Handwaving/web links to useful pages
  -->



The approach for calculating p-values for individual discriminator-sequence
matches is the same irrespective of which mode libscan is run in and is
summarised as follows: (i) Each discriminating element is scanned (scored)
against each sequence.  (ii) The ditribution of scores is generated for
each different type of element.  (iii) Using these distributions, a p-value
is calculated for each discriminator-sequence match.
The approach for calculating the 'combined p-value' for each individual
sequence is as follows: (i) p-values of the matches for the different types
of discriminator versus a sequence are multiplied to yield the 'product of
p-values'.  (ii) A distribution of 'product of p-values' is generated for
each individual sequence.  (iii) Using these distributions, a so-called
'combined p-value', reflecting the overall significance of the matches of
the sequence to the different types of discriminators, is generated.
Importantly, two (or more) p-values are only ever multiplied together if
corresponding hit is to the same region of the protein.  'Same' is defined
as two hits overlapping by a user-defined number of residues.

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>

    Warnings
</H2>

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.
   -->

The score distributions and therefore p-values are calculated only from the
data that libscan is provided.  Therefore, meaningful p-values are only
guaranteed if the sequence set (database search mode) or number of families
(library screeen mode) is sufficiently large.

<p>

Hidden Markov models can be generated for scop families by using hmmgen
which uses the HMMER package.

<p>

Simple frequency matrices, Gribskov profiles and Hennikoff profiles can be
generated for scop families by using profgen.

<p>

A 'signature file' contains a sparse sequence signature.  The files are
generated by siggen.

<p>

A 'signature hits file' contains the results of a search of a
discriminating element (one of protein signature, hidden Markov model,
simple frequency matrix, Gribskov profile or Hennikoff profile) against a
sequence database.  The files are generated by sigscan and modelscan.

<p>

A 'library scan file' holds the results of a search of a sequence against a
library of discriminating elements for scop families (one directory for
each type of element, e.g. sparse sequence signatures, profiles or HMMs).

<p>

The library scan file contains, for each invividual type of discriminating
element and for the combination of the elements, classification and other
data for each of a user-defined number of top-scoring families
(discriminators) from the scop database.

<p>

A 'scop classification file' contains classification and other data for
domains from the scop database.  The file is in embl-like format and is
generated by scopparse.  Domain sequence information can be added to the
file by using scopseqs.

<p>

A 'scop validation file' contains sequence relatives (hits) for each of a
number of different scop families, superfamilies and folds.  The file
contains the collated results from psiblast searches of a sequence database
for the indvidual scop families; hits of unambiguous family assignment are
listed under their respective family, otherwise a hit is assigned as
relatives to a scop superfamily or fold instead.  The scop validation file
is generated by seqnr and is in embl-like format.
