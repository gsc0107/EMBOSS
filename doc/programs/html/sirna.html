RNA interference, or RNAi, is a phenomenon in which double stranded RNA
(dsRNA) effects silencing of the expression of genes that are highly
homologous to either of the RNA strands in the duplex.  Gene silencing
in RNAi results from the degradation of mRNA sequences, and the effect
has been used to determine the function of many genes in Drosophilia, C. 
elegans, and many plant species. 

<p>

The duration of knockdown by siRNA can typically last for 7-10 days, and
has been shown to transfer to daughter cells.  Of further note, siRNAs
are effective at quantities much lower than alternative gene silencing
methodologies, including antisense and ribozyme based strategies. 

<p>
                       
Due to various mechanisms of antiviral response to long dsRNA, RNAi at
first proved more difficult to establish in mammalian species.  Then,
Tuschl, Elbashir, and others discovered that RNAi can be elicited very
effectively by well-defined 21-base duplex RNAs.  When these small
interfering RNA, or siRNA, are added in duplex form with a transfection
agent to mammalian cell cultures, the 21-base-pair RNA acts in concert
with cellular components to silence the gene with sequence homology to
one of the siRNA sequences. 

Strategies for the design of effective siRNA sequences have been
recently documented, most notably by Sayda Elbashir, Thomas Tuschl, et
al. 

<p>

Their studies of mammalian RNAi suggest that the most efficient
gene-silencing effect is achieved using double-stranded siRNA having a
19-nucleotide complementary region and a 2-nucleotide 3' overhang at
each end.  Current models of the RNAi mechanism suggest that the
antisense siRNA strand recognizes the specific gene target. 

<p>

In gene-specific RNAi, the coding region (CDS) of the mRNA is usually
targeted.  The search for an appropriate target sequence should begin
50-100 nucleotides downstream of the start codon.  UTR-binding proteins
and/or translation initiation complexes may interfere with the binding
of the siRNP endonuclease complex.  Tuschl, Elbashir et al.  say that
they have successfully used siRNAs targetting the 3' UTR. 


To avoid interference
from mRNA regulatory proteins, sequences in the 5' untranslated region
or near the start codon should not be targeted. 

<p>

A set of rules for the design of siRNA has been suggested <A href
="http://www.mpibpc.gwdg.de/abteilungen/100/105/sirna.html
">http://www.mpibpc.gwdg.de/abteilungen/100/105/sirna.html</a> based on
the work of Tuschl, Elbashir et al. 

<p>

They suggest searching for 23-nt sequence motif AA(N19)TT (N, any
nucleotide) and select hits with approx.  50% G/C-content (30% to 70%
has also worked in for them).  If no suitable sequences are found, the
search is extended using the motif NA(N21).  The sequence of the sense
siRNA corresponds to (N19)TT or N21 (position 3 to 23 of the 23-nt
motif), respectively.  In the latter case, they convert the 3' end of
the sense siRNA to TT. 

<p>

The rationale for this sequence conversion is to generate a symmetric
duplex with respect to the sequence composition of the sense and
antisense 3' overhangs.  The antisense siRNA is synthesized as the
complement to position 1 to 21 of the 23-nt motif.  Because position 1
of the 23-nt motif is not recognized sequence-specifically by the
antisense siRNA, the 3'-most nucleotide residue of the antisense siRNA,
can be chosen deliberately.  However, the penultimate nucleotide of the
antisense siRNA (complementary to position 2 of the 23-nt motif) should
always be complementary to the targeted sequence.  For simplifying
chemical synthesis, they always use TT.  

<p>

More recently, they preferentially select siRNAs corresponding to the
target motif NAR(N17)YNN, where R is purine (A, G) and Y is pyrimidine
(C, U).  The respective 21-nt sense and antisense siRNAs therefore begin
with a purine nucleotide and can also be expressed from pol III
expression vectors without a change in targeting site; expression of
RNAs from pol III promoters is only efficient when the first transcribed
nucleotide is a purine. 

<p>

They always design siRNAs with symmetric 3' TT overhangs, believing that
symmetric 3' overhangs help to ensure that the siRNPs are formed with
approximately equal ratios of sense and antisense target RNA-cleaving
siRNPs Please note that the modification of the overhang of the sense
sequence of the siRNA duplex is not expected to affect targeted mRNA
recognition, as the antisense siRNA strand guides target recognition. 
In summary, no matter what you do to your overhangs, siRNAs should still
function to a reasonable extent.  However, using TT in the 3' overhang
will always help your RNA synthesis company to let you know when you
accidentally order a siRNA sequences 3' to 5' rather than in the
recommended format of 5' to 3'.  

<p>

<b>sirna</b> reports both the sense and antisense siRNAs as 5' to 3'. 

<p>

<a href="http://www.xeragon.com/siRNA_support.html">Xeragon.com</a> also
suggest that choosing a 21 nt region of the mRNA with a GC content as
close as possible to 50% is a more important consideration than choosing
a target sequence that begins with AA.  They also suggest that a key
consideration in target selection is to avoid having more than three
guanosines in a row, since poly G sequences can hyperstack and form
agglomerates that potentially interfere with the siRNA silencing
mechanism.

<p>

siRNAs appear to effectively silence genes in more than 80% of cases. 
Current data indicate that there are regions of some mRNAs where gene
silencing does not work.  To help ensure that a given target gene is
silenced, it is advised that at least two target sequences as far apart
on the gene as possible be chosen. 

<p>

mRNA secondary structure does not appear to have a significant effect on
gene silencing. 

<p>

<b>sirna</b> looks at the feature table of the input mRNA sequence to
find the coding regions (CDS).  It will ignore the 5' UTR and the first
50 bases of the CDS.  It will assign a penalty of 2 points to any siRNA
in positions 51 to 100 in the CDS.  If there is no CDS in the feature
table, you can specify the CDS by using the command-line qualifier
'-sbegin' to indicate where the CDS should start.  If there is no CDS in
the feature table and you do not use the command-line qualifier
'-sbegin', then <b>sirna</b> will assume that the CDS region is not
known and will look for siRNAs in the whole of the sequence with no
penalties.
