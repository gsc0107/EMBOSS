<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>esim4</b> is a similarity-based tool for aligning an expressed DNA
sequence (EST, cDNA, mRNA) with a genomic sequence for the gene. It
also detects end matches when the two input sequences overlap at one
end (i.e., the start of one sequence overlaps the end of the
other). If seqfile2 is a database of sequences, the sequence in
seqfile1 will be aligned with each of the sequences in seqfile2.





<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


sim4 employs a blast-based technique to first determine the basic
matching blocks representing the "exon cores". In this first stage, it
detects all possible exact matches of W-mers (i.e., DNA words of size
W) between the two sequences and extends them to maximal scoring
gap-free segments. In the second stage, the exon cores are extended
into the adjacent as-yet-unmatched fragments using greedy alignment
algorithms, and heuristics are used to favor configurations that
conform to the splice-site recognition signals (GT-AG, CT-AC). If
necessary, the process is repeated with less stringent parameters on
the unmatched fragments.

<p>
By default, sim4 searches both strands and reports the best match,
measured by the number of matching nucleotides found in the
alignment. The R command line option can be used to restrict the
search to one orientation (strand) only.

<p>
Currently, five major alignment display options are supported,
controlled by the A option. By default (A=0), only the endpoints,
overall similarity, and orientation of the introns are reported. An
arrow sign (`->' or `<-') indicates the orientation of the intron (`+'
or `-' strand), when the signals flanking the intron have three or
more position matches with either the GT-AG or the CT-AC splice
recognition signals. When the same number of matches is found for both
orientations, the intron is reported as ambiguous, and represented by
`--'. The sign `==' marks the absence from the alignment of a cDNA
fragment starting at that position. Alternative formats (lav-block
format, text, PipMaker-type `exons file', or certain combinations of
these options) can be requested by specifying a different value for A.

<p>
If the P option is specified with a non-zero value, sim4 will remove
any 3'-end poly-A tails that it detects in the alignment.

<p>
Occasionally, sim4 may miss an internal exon when surrounded by very
large introns, typically longer than 100 Kb. When this is suspected,
the H option can be used to reset the exons' weight to compensate for
the intron gap penalty.

<p>
Ambiguity codes are by default allowed in sequence data, but sim4
treats them non-differentially. If desired, the B command option can
restrict the set of acceptable characters to A,C,G,T,N and X only.

<p>
sim4 compares the lengths of the input sequences to distinguish
between the cDNA (`short') and the genomic (`long') components in the
comparison. When seqfile2 contains a collection of sequences, the
first entry in the file will be used to determine the type of this and
all subsequent comparisons.

<p>
In the description of program options, the term MSP denotes a maximal
segment pair, that is, a pair of highly similar fragments in the two
sequences, obtained during the blast-like procedure by extending a
W-mer hit by matches and perhaps a few mismatches.
