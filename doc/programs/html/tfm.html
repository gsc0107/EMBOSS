    Description

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.

        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will
        do what he wants. 

        Long description.

        Why it is useful.

        When it should/shouldn't be used.

        Algorithms

        Expanded description.

        eg: Reverse engineers Wheedle's 'talpsgob' program. This does a 
        splurge of the 5' end of the sequence followed by a durm.
        The net effect is a 5' end splurt.
        etc. for as long as is required (several pages is not unreasonable)

This program displays the help documentation for an EMBOSS program.
<P>

The contributors of the EMBOSS programs do attempt to provide an adequate
description of the programs. This documentation is primarily held as HTML pages
at
<A HREF="http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/">http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/</A>

<P>
The documentation is also available however through the program
<B>tfm</B> as normal text.

<P>
<B>tfm</B> is unusual for an EMBOSS program in that it expects to be used
interactively and so it displays the documentation text a page at a time,
pausing after every page for the user to proess the <B>SPACE</B> bar on
their keyboard. (i.e. it uses the UNIX program <B>more</B> to display the
information). This behaviour can be turned off by using the qualifier
<b>-nomore</b>.


 
<P>
If you have problems understanding the function
or usage of an EMBOSS program, then you should contact the EMBOSS mailing
list (emboss@embnet.org).

<P>
The unusual name of this program comes from the common computing science
expression: <b>RTFM</B>. This acronym, as you probably already know, stands for
<B>Read The Fine* Manual</B>; so this is <B>The Fine* Manual</B>.
<P>

* Insert the expletive of your choice here!

    Usage

	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

                                 wossname 
                                      
   
   
Function

   Finds programs by keywords in their one-line documentation
   
Description

   This allows a user to search for keywords or parts of words in the
   brief documentation (as displayed by a program when it first starts).
   The program name and the brief description is output. If no words to
   search for are specified, then details of all the EMBOSS programs are
   output.
   
   The program has been written on the assumption that most people will
   use it to quickly find the name of a program based on that program's
   description, so the output goes to the screen by default.
   
   This program may find some use in automatically generating lists of
   EMBOSS programs and their groups for Web pages.
   
Usage

   Here are some sample sessions with wossname.

        Search for programs with 'restrict' in their description
        % wossname restrict

        Display a listing of programs in their groups
        % wossname -search ''

        Display an alphabetic listing of all programs
        % wossname -search '' -alphabetic

        Display only the groups that the programs can belong to
        % wossname -search '' -groups
        
        Output html tags around the list of program groups
        % wossname '' -groups -html -prelink '#'

        Output html tags around the list of programs
        % wossname '' -html -prelink
          'http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/' -postlink '.shtml'

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-search]            string     Enter a word or words here and a
                                  case-independent search for it will be made
                                  in the one-line documentation of all of the
                                  EMBOSS programs. If no keyword is specified,
                                  all programs will be listed.

   Optional qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -explode            boolean    The groups that EMBOSS applications belong
                                  to have two forms, exploded and not
                                  exploded. The exploded group names are more
                                  numerous and often vaguely phrased than the
                                  non-exploded ones. The exploded names are
                                  formed from definitions of the group names
                                  that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are
                                  then expanded into many combinations of the
                                  names as: 'NAME1', 'NAME2', 'NAME1 NAME2',
                                  NAME2 NAME1'. The non-expanded names are
                                  simply like: 'NAME1 NAME2'.
   -outfile            outfile    If you enter the name of a file here then
                                  this program will write the program names
                                  and brief descriptions into that file.
   -html               boolean    If you are sending the output to a file,
                                  this will format it for displaying as a
                                  table in a WWW document.
*  -prelink            string     If you are outputting to a file in HTML
                                  format, you can make the program names into
                                  hyper-links by setting this to be the first
                                  half of the URL.
                                  For example, if you wish the program name to
                                  be a hyperlink to the URL:
                                  http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps
/programname.html
                                  then if you enter
                                  http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps
/
                                  here, then the first half of the URL before
                                  the programname will be set.
*  -postlink           string     If you are outputting to a file in HTML
                                  format, you can make the program names into
                                  hyper-links by setting this to be the second
                                  half of the URL.
                                  For example, if you wish the program name to
                                  be a hyperlink to the URL:
                                  http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps
/programname.html
                                  then if you enter '.html' here, the second
                                  half of the URL after the programname will
                                  be set.
   -groups             boolean    If you use this option, then only the group
                                  names will output to the file
   -alphabetic         boolean    If you use this option, then you will get a
                                  single list of the program names and
                                  descriptions instead of the programs being
                                  listed in their functional groups.

   Advanced qualifiers:

   and interactive editors. This option allows you to only report those
   programs that can be run from a GUI Yes/No No
   
Input file format

   The program reads the brief descriptions and the program groups from
   the ACD files. (ACD files control the parameters that the programs
   expect - don't worry about them unless you are writing EMBOSS
   programs).
   
   The format of ACD files is documented elsewhere.
   
Output file format

   The results are written out as a simple list preceded by the group
   that the programs belong to or the word that is being searched for.
   e.g.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% wossname 'rest'
SEARCH FOR 'REST'
redata           Isoschizomers, references and suppliers for restriction enzyme
s
restrict         Finds restriction enzyme cleavage sites
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   If the -html, -prelink and -postlink qualifiers are specified, then
   the output will be wrapped in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web
   page. Note that tags such as <HTML>, <BODY>, </BODY> and </HTML> are
   not output by this program as the list of programs is expected to form
   only part of the contents of a web page - the rest of the web page
   must be supplied by the user.
   
Data files

   As noted above, the program ACD files are searched. The average user
   will not need to worry about this.
   
Notes

   If a program's ACD file does not assign the program to a group, it
   will be automatically assigned to the group 'ASSORTED'.
   
   A program can belong to more than one group.
   
   The name of this program comes from its use as a favorite word of the
   author Terry Pratchett. It is used especially by the characters of the
   parrot in Eric and the dog Gaspode in Moving Pictures and Men at Arms.

Text documentation is output.

<P>

The table of command line arguments can be a bit difficult to read. This is the
result of changing HTML Web pages to text.

<p>

You will see a page of documentation on the <b>wossname</B> program.
To see further pages, you should press the <B>SPACE</B> bar on your keyboard.
To stop seeing the documentation before you get to the end of the text, you
can press the key <b>q</b> to quit.

    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.

        eg:
        data file format:

	blank lines and comment lines are ignored.
        comment lines start with '#'
        There are three columns separated by one or more space or TAB
	characters for X and Y values of durm, followed by energy
        all coefficients are given as floating point values
        An example is:

        # Durm coefficient enery file
        # X     Y       Energy
        0.1     0.2     0.331
        0.2     0.4     0.332
        0.3     0.6     0.333

    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

<!-- 
        Error messages specific to this program.
        eg:

        "Threshold value greater than 1." - means that the threshold has
        been set to be greater than 1 but a burgle exception has
        occurred making this invalid - you should reduce the wobble
        parameter and try again.

<b>tfm</b> will warn you if you have supplied the name of a program which is not
documented yet or which doesn't exist in EMBOSS.
