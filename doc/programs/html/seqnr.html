SEQNR removes redundancy from DHF files (domain hits files) or other files of sequences.  A directory of DHF files (all sequences) is read and a directory of new DHF files (non-redundant sequences) plus (optionally) a second directory of DHF files (redundant sequences) is written.  Optionally, up to two further directories of filter sequences may be read: these are considered in the redundancy calculation but never appear in the output files.   Typically, one of the further directories contains DHF files each with a single sequence and the other DAF files (domain alignment files) each containing a sequence alignment, but any sequence(s) may be given.  Each filter directory must contain a file for each file in main input directory and the files must have the same base name.  For example, sequences from "family.dhf" and "family.daf" are considered for the input DHF file "family.hits". 
<br>Redundancy is removed at either (i) a user-defined threshold of sequence similarity or (ii) a user-defined range of threshold sequence similarity. Files of sequences in any supported format may be read and written (not just DHF or DAF files). A log file is also written.
<br>The path for all files (input and output) are specified by the user.  The file extensions are set in the ACD file.  The name of the log file is set by the user.





<!-- INPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of input file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.

     Cannot use the test data files because they might be empty or need 
     hand-editing 

     Use "<b>SEQNR</b> reads any normal sequence USAs." if
     appropriate.

                                  EMBL-like). The hits are relatives to a SCOP
                                  or CATH family and are found from a search
                                  of a sequence database. Files containing
                                  hits retrieved by PSIBLAST are generated by
                                  using SEQSEARCH.
   -[no]dosing         toggle     This option specifies whether to use singlet
                                  sequences (e.g. DHF files) to filter input.
                                  Optionally, up to two further directories
                                  of sequences may be read: these are
                                  considered in the redundancy calculation but
                                  never appear in the output files.
*  -singletsdir        directory  This option specifies the location of
                                  singlet filter sequences (e.g. DHF files)
                                  (input). A 'domain hits file' contains
                                  database hits (sequences) with domain

                                  are generated by using SEQSEARCH.
   -[no]dosets         toggle     This option specifies whether to use sets of
                                  sequences (e.g. DHF files) to filter input.
                                  Optionally, up to two further directories

                                  considered in the redundancy calculation but
                                  never appear in the output files.
*  -insetsdir          directory  This option specifies location of sets of
                                  filter sequences (e.g. DAF files) (input). A
                                  'domain alignment file' contains a sequence
                                  alignment of domains belonging to the same
                                  SCOP or CATH family. The file is in clustal
                                  format annotated with domain family
                                  classification information. The files
                                  generated by using SCOPALIGN will contain a

                                  domains of known structure only. Such
                                  alignments can be extended with sequence
                                  relatives (of unknown structure) by using
                                  SEQALIGN.
   -mode               menu       This option specifies whether to remove
                                  redundancy at a single threshold % sequence
                                  similarity or remove redundancy outside a
                                  range of acceptable threshold % similarity.
                                  All permutations of pair-wise sequence
                                  alignments are calculated for each set of
                                  input sequences in turn using the EMBOSS
                                  implementation of the Needleman and Wunsch
                                  global alignment algorithm. Redundant
                                  sequences are removed in one of two modes as
                                  follows: (i) If a pair of proteins achieve
                                  greater than a threshold percentage sequence
                                  similarity (specified by the user) the
                                  shortest sequence is discarded. (ii) If a
                                  pair of proteins have a percentage sequence
                                  similarity that lies outside an acceptable
                                  range (specified by the user) the shortest
                                  sequence is discarded.
*  -thresh             float      This option specifies the % sequence
                                  identity redundancy threshold. The %
                                  sequence identity redundancy threshold
                                  determines the redundancy calculation. If a
                                  pair of proteins achieve greater than this
                                  threshold the shortest sequence is
                                  discarded.
*  -threshlow          float      This option specifies the % sequence
                                  identity redundancy threshold (lower limit).
                                  The % sequence identity redundancy
                                  threshold determines the redundancy
                                  calculation. If a pair of proteins have a
                                  percentage sequence similarity that lies
                                  outside an acceptable range the shortest
                                  sequence is discarded.
*  -threshup           float      This option specifies the % sequence
                                  identity redundancy threshold (upper limit).

                                  outside an acceptable range the shortest
                                  sequence is discarded.
  [-dhfoutdir]         outdir     This option specifies the location of DHF
                                  files (domain hits files) of non-redundant
                                  sequences (output). A 'domain hits file'
                                  contains database hits (sequences) with
                                  domain classification information, in the
                                  DHF format (FASTA or EMBL-like). The hits
                                  are relatives to a SCOP or CATH family and
                                  are found from a search of a sequence
                                  database. Files containing hits retrieved by
                                  PSIBLAST are generated by using SEQSEARCH.
   -dored              toggle     This option specifies whether to retain
                                  redundant sequences. If this option is set a
                                  DHF file (domain hits file) of redundant
                                  sequences is written.
*  -redoutdir          outdir     This option specifies the location of DHF
                                  files (domain hits files) of redundant
                                  sequences (output). A 'domain hits file'
                                  contains database hits (sequences) with
                                  domain classification information, in the
                                  DHF format (FASTA or EMBL-like). The hits
                                  are relatives to a SCOP or CATH family and
                                  are found from a search of a sequence
                                  database. Files containing hits retrieved by
                                  PSIBLAST are generated by using SEQSEARCH.
   -logfile            outfile    This option specifies the name of SEQNR log
                                  file (output). The log file contains
                                  messages about any errors arising while
                                  SEQNR ran.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -matrix             matrixf    This option specifies the residue
                                  substitution matrix that is used for
                                  sequence comparison.
   -gapopen            float      This option specifies the gap insertion
                                  penalty. The gap insertion penalty is the
                                  score taken away when a gap is created. The
                                  best value depends on the choice of
                                  comparison matrix. The default value assumes
                                  you are using the EBLOSUM62 matrix for
                                  protein sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix
                                  for nucleotide sequences.
   -gapextend          float      This option specifies the gap extension
                                  penalty. The gap extension, penalty is added
                                  to the standard gap penalty for each base
                                  or residue in the gap. This is how long gaps
                                  are penalized. Usually you will expect a
                                  few long gaps rather than many short gaps,
                                  so the gap extension penalty should be lower
                                  than the gap penalty.

<!-- DESCRIPTION
     A complete, non-technical, user-level description of the application.
-->
<a name="9.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 9.0   DESCRIPTION               </H2>

Redundancy in a database or other collection of sequences occurs when
one or more similar sequences are present. The inclusion of very
similar sequences in certain analyses will introduce undesirable bias.
For example, a family may possess 100 sequences in the sequence
database, but 90 of these might be essentially the same sequence,
e.g. very close relatives or mutations of a single sequence.  Although
100 sequences are known, the family only contains 11 sequences that
are essentially unique.  For many applications it is desirable or even
essential to remove redundant sequences from a set in order to produce
a smaller set that is representative of the whole. SEQNR removes
redundancy from an input file of sequences, either at a single
threshold of sequence similiarty (e.g. 40%) or within a threshold
range of sequence similiarty (e.g. 40% - 70%).





<!-- ALGORITHM
     A technical description of algorithmic aspects, describing exactly how
     the key aspects of the application work.
-->
<a name="10.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 10.0  ALGORITHM                 </H2>

Redundancy is calculated for each DHF file in the input directory in
turn.  The procedure is as follows. 1.  Create a list of sequences
from the main input directory.  2. Add sequences from both filter
directories (if specified) to list but mark them up (they are
considered in the redundancy calculation but never appear in the
output files).  3. Identify redundant domains. 4. Write non-redundant
domains to main output directory.  5.  If specified, write redundant
domains to output directory.





<!-- RELATED APPLICATIONS
