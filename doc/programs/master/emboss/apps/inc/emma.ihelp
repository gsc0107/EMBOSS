                                  There are three 'in-built' series of weight
                                  matrices offered. Each consists of several
                                  matrices which work differently at different
                                  evolutionary distances. To see the exact
                                  details, read the documentation. Crudely, we
                                  store several matrices in memory, spanning
                                  the full range of amino acid distance (from
                                  almost identical sequences to highly
                                  divergent ones). For very similar sequences,
                                  it is best to use a strict weight matrix
                                  which only gives a high score to identities
                                  and the most favoured conservative
                                  substitutions. For more divergent sequences,
                                  it is appropriate to use 'softer' matrices
                                  which give a high score to many other
                                  frequent substitutions.

                                  to be the best available for carrying out
                                  data base similarity (homology searches).
                                  The matrices used are: Blosum80, 62, 45 and

                                  2) PAM (Dayhoff). These have been extremely
                                  widely used since the late '70s. We use the
                                  PAM 120, 160, 250 and 350 matrices.
                                  3) GONNET . These matrices were derived
                                  using almost the same procedure as the
                                  Dayhoff one (above) but are much more up to
                                  date and are based on a far larger data set.
                                  They appear to be more sensitive than the
                                  Dayhoff series. We use the GONNET 40, 80,
                                  120, 160, 250 and 350 matrices.
                                  We also supply an identity matrix which
                                  gives a score of 1.0 to two identical amino
                                  acids and a score of zero otherwise. This
                                  matrix is not very useful.
*  -pwdnamatrix        menu       The scoring table which describes the scores

                                  choice of weight matrices. The default for
                                  proteins is the PAM series derived by Gonnet
                                  and colleagues. Note, a series is used! The
                                  actual matrix that is used depends on how
                                  similar the sequences to be aligned at this
                                  alignment step are. Different matrices work
                                  differently at each evolutionary distance.

                                  you can read in your own (just one matrix,
                                  not a series).
*  -dnamatrix          menu       This gives a menu where you are offered
                                  amenu where a single matrix (not a series)
                                  can be selected.
*  -mamatrix           infile     Filename of user multiple alignment matrix
   -[no]slow           toggle     A distance is calculated between every pair
                                  of sequences and these are used to construct
                                  the dendrogram which guides the final
                                  multiple alignment. The scores are
                                  calculated from separate pairwise
                                  alignments. These can be calculated using 2
                                  methods: dynamic programming (slow but
                                  accurate) or by the method of Wilbur and
                                  Lipman (extremely fast but approximate).
                                  The slow-accurate method is fine for short
                                  sequences but will be VERY SLOW for many
                                  (e.g. >100) long (e.g. >1000 residue)
                                  sequences.
*  -pwgapopen          float      The penalty for opening a gap in the
                                  pairwise alignments.
*  -pwgapextend        float      The penalty for extending a gap by 1 residue
                                  in the pairwise alignments.
*  -ktup               integer    This is the size of exactly matching
                                  fragment that is used. INCREASE for speed
                                  (max= 2 for proteins; 4 for DNA), DECREASE
                                  for sensitivity. For longer sequences (e.g.
                                  >1000 residues) you may need to increase the
                                  default.
*  -gapw               integer    This is a penalty for each gap in the fast
                                  alignments. It has little affect on the
                                  speed or sensitivity except for extreme
                                  values.
*  -topdiags           integer    The number of k-tuple matches on each
                                  diagonal (in an imaginary dot-matrix plot)
                                  is calculated. Only the best ones (with most
                                  matches) are used in the alignment. This
                                  parameter specifies how many. Decrease for
                                  speed; increase for sensitivity.
*  -window             integer    This is the number of diagonals around each
                                  of the 'best' diagonals that will be used.
                                  Decrease for speed; increase for
                                  sensitivity.
*  -nopercent          boolean    Fast pairwise alignment: similarity scores:
                                  suppresses percentage score
   -gapopen            float      The penalty for opening a gap in the
                                  alignment. Increasing the gap opening
                                  penalty will make gaps less frequent.
   -gapextend          float      The penalty for extending a gap by 1
                                  residue. Increasing the gap extension
                                  penalty will make gaps shorter. Terminal
                                  gaps are not penalised.
   -[no]endgaps        boolean    End gap separation: treats end gaps just
                                  like internal gaps for the purposes of
                                  avoiding gaps that are too close (set by
                                  'gap separation distance'). If you turn this
                                  off, end gaps will be ignored for this
                                  purpose. This is useful when you wish to
                                  align fragments where the end gaps are not
                                  biologically meaningful.
   -gapdist            integer    Gap separation distance: tries to decrease
                                  the chances of gaps being too close to each
                                  other. Gaps that are less than this distance
                                  apart are penalised more than other gaps.
                                  This does not prevent close gaps; it makes
                                  them less frequent, promoting a block-like
                                  appearance of the alignment.
*  -norgap             boolean    Residue specific penalties: amino acid
                                  specific gap penalties that reduce or
                                  increase the gap opening penalties at each
                                  position in the alignment or sequence. As an
                                  example, positions that are rich in glycine
                                  are more likely to have an adjacent gap
                                  than positions that are rich in valine.
*  -hgapres            string     This is a set of the residues 'considered'
                                  to be hydrophilic. It is used when
                                  introducing Hydrophilic gap penalties.
*  -nohgap             boolean    Hydrophilic gap penalties: used to increase
                                  the chances of a gap within a run (5 or more
                                  residues) of hydrophilic amino acids; these
                                  are likely to be loop or random coil
                                  regions where gaps are more common. The
                                  residues that are 'considered' to be
                                  hydrophilic are set by '-hgapres'.
   -maxdiv             integer    This switch, delays the alignment of the
                                  most distantly related sequences until after
                                  the most closely related sequences have
                                  been aligned. The setting shows the percent
                                  identity level required to delay the
                                  addition of a sequence; sequences that are
                                  less identical than this level to any other
                                  sequences will be aligned later.
