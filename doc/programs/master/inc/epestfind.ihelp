   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          sequence   Protein sequence USA to be analysed.
   -window             integer    Minimal distance between positively charged
                                  amino acids.
   -order              selection  Name of the output file which holds the
                                  results of the analysis. Results may be
                                  sorted by length, position and score.
  [-outfile]           outfile    Name of file to which results will be
                                  written.
   -graph              xygraph    Graph type

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -aadata             datafile   File of amino acid properties and molecular
                                  masses.
   -threshold          float      Threshold value to discriminate weak from
                                  potential PEST motifs. Valid PEST motifs are
                                  discriminated into 'poor' and 'potential'
                                  motifs depending on this threshold score. By
                                  default, the default value is set to +5.0
                                  based on experimental data. Alterations are
                                  not recommended since significance is a
                                  matter of biology, not mathematics.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -[no]potential      boolean    Decide whether potential PEST motifs should
                                  be printed.
   -[no]poor           boolean    Decide whether poor PEST motifs should be
                                  printed.
   -invalid            boolean    Decide whether invalid PEST motifs should be
                                  printed.
   -[no]map            boolean    Decide whether PEST motifs should be mapped
                                  to sequence.
