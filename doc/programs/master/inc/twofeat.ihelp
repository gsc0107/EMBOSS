   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -asource            string     By default any feature source in the feature
                                  table is allowed. You can set this to match
                                  any feature source you wish to allow.
                                  The source name is usually either the name
                                  of the program that detected the feature or
                                  it is the feature table (eg: EMBL) that the
                                  feature came from.
                                  The source may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to allow more than one source,
                                  separate their names with the character '|',
                                  eg:

   -asense             menu       By default any feature sense is allowed. You
                                  can set this to match the required sense.
   -aminscore          float      If this is greater than or equal to the
                                  maximum score, then any score is allowed.
   -amaxscore          float      If this is less than or equal to the maximum
                                  score, then any score is permitted.
   -atag               string     Tags are the types of extra values that a
                                  feature may have. For example in the EMBL
                                  feature table, a 'CDS' type of feature may
                                  have the tags '/codon', '/codon_start',
                                  '/db_xref', '/EC_number', '/evidence',

                                  '/usedin'. Some of these tags also have
                                  values, for example '/gene' can have the
                                  value of the gene name.
                                  By default any feature tag in the feature
                                  table is allowed. You can set this to match
                                  any feature tag you wish to allow.
                                  The tag may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to allow more than one tag,
                                  separate their names with the character '|',
                                  eg:
                                  gene | label
   -avalue             string     Tag values are the values associated with a
                                  feature tag. Tags are the types of extra
                                  values that a feature may have. For example
                                  in the EMBL feature table, a 'CDS' type of
                                  feature may have the tags '/codon',
                                  '/codon_start', '/db_xref', '/EC_number',
                                  '/evidence', '/exception', '/function',

                                  '/transl_table', or '/usedin'. Only some of
                                  these tags can have values, for example
                                  '/gene' can have the value of the gene name.
                                  By default any feature tag value in the
                                  feature table is allowed. You can set this
                                  to match any feature tag value you wish to
                                  allow.
                                  The tag value may be wildcarded by using
                                  '*'.

                                  character '|', eg:

                                  any feature source you wish to allow.
                                  The source name is usually either the name
                                  of the program that detected the feature or
                                  it is the feature table (eg: EMBL) that the
                                  feature came from.
                                  The source may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to allow more than one source,
                                  separate their names with the character '|',

                                  feature may have. For example in the EMBL
                                  feature table, a 'CDS' type of feature may
                                  have the tags '/codon', '/codon_start',

                                  value of the gene name.

                                  any feature tag you wish to allow.
                                  The tag may be wildcarded by using '*'.

                                  allow.
                                  The tag value may be wildcarded by using

                                  You can allow any or no overlaps, specify
                                  that they must or must not overlap, that one
                                  must or must not be wholly enclosed within

   -order              menu       This allows you to specify the required

                                  measured from the start positions of the
                                  features. This criterion is always applied
