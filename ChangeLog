Version 2.4.0

	NBRF sequence reading trims last character only if it is '*'
	to catch cases where SRS reports the sequence as 'plain'

	GCG database text has the spaces in ". ." strings removed.

	Database entry text and sequence saved for binary formats (GCG, BLAST)
	for use by entret and other applications

	dbiblast indices with split databases (formatdb -v) fixed for reading
	all entries (was only reading the first file)

	dbiblast and dbigcg indices support exclude and file definitions
	to create database subsets

	Database include and file definitions can use the simple filename.
	In some cases the full path was used. Database files are checked
	both with and without the directory path for back-compatibility.

	srswww access method created to query a remote web server.
	Preferred to using URL access as SRS queries can be built

	Sequence objects include the SeqVersion, Keyword list and Taxonomy
	list.

	SeqVersion (EMBL SV line, GenBank VERSION line) is used in preference
	to accession number where available. Can also be read in FASTA
	and NCBI formats. Where only the SeqVersion is available, the
	accession number is generated.
	
	USA queries implement searches by SV, DES, ORG and KEY. These work
	with SRS access methods (SRS, SRSFASTA, SRSWWW) by building SRS
	queries, and with direct access (simple file reading) by
	testing the sequence object.

	Key and Org queries are for full keywords (including spaces) and
	for each level of the taxonomy.

	Des queries, if the access method does not provide a mechanism,
	(if the access method does not have its own index) are applied to
	words within the description. Words start with a letter or number,
	and end with a letter or number. SRS typically does the same, but
	allows a single quote at the end. This catches words such as 3'
	and 5' but is a problem with some quoted text.

	Queries for ID ACC SV DES ORG and KEY are valid for all file
	access methods, including URL, external, cmd, app, file and by
	default any new method added. If the internal query data is not
	flagged by the access method (to show the database has been
	queried) the sequence object is automatically tested.

	Missing description, keyword, organism, or seqversion fields cause
	queries to fail if they are used on inappropriate data.
	
	Known problem: Queries of dbiflat (etc.) databases for SV DES ORG
	and KEY will need new index files.

	New database definition token 'fields' with a list of indexed fields
	can be set to 'sv des org key' for SRS databases. 

	USAs check the query field against the database 'fields'
	definition.  ID and ACC are always allowed. dbname:name still
	searches ID and ACC (no change from previous version)

	USAs with a filename can include the new query fields. The syntax is
	filename:field:query for example empro.dat:id:eclaci (the extended
	syntax is because empro.dat-id:eclaci looks like a filename ending
	in -id)

        Application 'tranalign' added. 
        This aligns nucleic coding regions based on a set of aligned proteins.

	
Version 2.3.1

        est2genome fixed for large alignments (over 40Mbase for
        est * genomic sequence length)
        sequence reading for ABI files fixed (and selex files tested)
        genbank feature input working
        pepinfo PNG output larger to make the text readable (only affects
        PNG output)
	empty sequence file input fails gracefully
	empty sequence input fails gracefully (and only needs one
	^D from stdin)
	
Version 2.3.0

        Seqretall, seqretallfeat and seqretset moved to 'make check'.
        Seqret has all the functionality of the above.
	Fix for NBRF accession number reading (ajseqread.c)
	Whichdb program added.
	Fix for dbifasta and wormpep
	Fix for problem reading plain format sequences by primer3.
        Primer3 renamed eprimer3 to avoid conflicts with the Whitehead's
	primer3 version 3.0.6.
	transeq's '-frame' can have a list of values, as: '-frame=1,2,3'
	Non-existent files in lists are again ignored
	Various wildcard database search fixes
	ESIM4 added as an embassy package
