Searches ligand-signature library and writes hits (LHF file)
Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-siginfilesdir]     dirlist    [./] This option specifies the directory of
                                  signature files (input). A 'signature file'
                                  contains a sparse sequence signature
                                  suitable for use with the SIGSCAN and
                                  SIGSCANLIG programs. The files are generated
                                  by using SIGGEN and SIGGENLIG.
  [-dbseqall]          seqall     This option specifies the name of the
                                  database of query sequences.
   -sub                matrixf    [EBLOSUM62] This option specifies the
                                  scoring matrix to use, e.g. residue
                                  substitution matrix (1D signatures) or
                                  matrix of 3D:1D (environment:residue) scores
                                  (3D).
   -mode               menu       [1] This option specifies the mode of
                                  scoring ligands. In 'Patch Score Mode' (mode
                                  1) the score for a ligand is the mean of
                                  its patch scores. In 'Site Score Mode' the
                                  score for a ligand is the mean of its site
                                  scores. A site score is the mean of patch
                                  score for all patches for a given site.
                                  (Values: 1 (Patch score mode); 2 (Site score
                                  mode))
   -gapo               float      [10.0 for any sequence] This option
                                  specifies the gap insertion penalty. The gap
                                  insertion penalty is the score taken away
                                  when a gap is created. The best value
                                  depends on the choice of comparison matrix.
                                  The default value assumes you are using the
                                  EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, and
                                  the EDNAMAT matrix for nucleotide sequences.
                                  (Floating point number from 1.0 to 100.0)
   -gape               float      [0.5 for any sequence] This option specifies
                                  the gap extension penalty. The gap
                                  extension penalty is added to the standard
                                  gap penalty for each base or residue in the
                                  gap. This is how long gaps are penalized.
                                  Usually you will expect a few long gaps
                                  rather than many short gaps, so the gap
                                  extension penalty should be lower than the
                                  gap penalty. (Floating point number from 0.0
                                  to 10.0)
   -nterm              menu       [1] This option specifies the N-terminal
                                  matching option. This determines how the
                                  first signature position is aligned to a
                                  sequence from the database. (Values: 1
                                  (Align anywhere and allow only complete
                                  signature-sequence fit); 2 (Align anywhere
                                  and allow partial signature-sequence fit); 3
                                  (Use empirical gaps only))
  [-hitsoutdir]        outdir     [./] This option specifies the directory of
                                  the LHF files (ligand hits files) (output).
                                  A 'ligand hits file' contains database hits
                                  (sequences) with ligand classification
                                  information, in the LHF format (FASTA-like).
                                  The hits are putative ligand-binding
                                  sequences and are found from a search of a
                                  sequence database, in this case, by using
                                  SIGSCANLIG.
  [-alignoutdir]       outdir     [./] This option specifies the name of the
                                  SAF (signature alignment file) (output).A
                                  'signature alignment file' contains one or
                                  more signnature-sequence alignments. The
                                  file is in DAF format (CLUSTAL-like) and is
                                  annotated with bibliographic information,
                                  either the domain family classification (for
                                  SIGSCAN output) or ligand classification
                                  (for SIGSCANLIG output). The files generated
                                  by SIGSCAN will contain a
                                  signature-sequence alignment for a single
                                  signature against a library of one or more
                                  sequences. The files generated by using
                                  SIGSCANLIG will contain a signature-sequence
                                  alignment for a single query sequence
                                  against a library of one or more signatures.
  [-resultsoutdir]     outdir     [./] This option specifies the directory for
                                  the results files. A results file is
                                  generated for each query sequence and
                                  contains a list of hits (ligands),
                                  rank-ordered on the basis of score.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -nhits              integer    [100] This option specifies the maximum
                                  number of hits to output. (Any integer
                                  value)
   -domax              toggle     [N] This option specifies whether to
                                  consider a max. number of top-scoring hits
                                  only for each ligand.
*  -maxhits            integer    [0] This option specifies the maximum number
                                  of top-scoring hits to consider for each
                                  ligand. (Any integer value)
