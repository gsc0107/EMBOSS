Function

   Interactive DNA parsimony

Description

   Interactive construction of phylogenies from nucleic acid sequences,
   with their evaluation by parsimony and compatibility and the display of
   reconstructed ancestral bases. This can be used to find parsimony or
   compatibility estimates by hand.

Algorithm

   DNAMOVE is an interactive DNA parsimony program, inspired by Wayne
   Maddison and David and Wayne Maddison's marvellous program MacClade,
   which is written for Macintosh computers. DNAMOVE reads in a data set
   which is prepared in almost the same format as one for the DNA
   parsimony program DNAPARS. It allows the user to choose an initial
   tree, and displays this tree on the screen. The user can look at
   different sites and the way the nucleotide states are distributed on
   that tree, given the most parsimonious reconstruction of state changes
   for that particular tree. The user then can specify how the tree is to
   be rearraranged, rerooted or written out to a file. By looking at
   different rearrangements of the tree the user can manually search for
   the most parsimonious tree, and can get a feel for how different sites
   are affected by changes in the tree topology.

   This program uses graphic characters that show the tree to best
   advantage on some computer systems. Its graphic characters will work
   best on MSDOS systems or MSDOS windows in Windows, and to any system
   whose screen or terminals emulate ANSI standard terminals such as old
   Digital VT100 terminals, Telnet programs, or VT100-compatible windows
   in the X windowing system. For any other screen types, (such as
   Macintosh windows) there is a generic option which does not make use of
   screen graphics characters. The program will work well in those cases,
   but the tree it displays will look a bit uglier.

   This program carries out unrooted parsimony (analogous to Wagner trees)
   (Eck and Dayhoff, 1966; Kluge and Farris, 1969) on DNA sequences. The
   method of Fitch (1971) is used to count the number of changes of base
   needed on a given tree.

   The assumptions of this method are exactly analogous to those of MIX:
    1. Each site evolves independently.
    2. Different lineages evolve independently.
    3. The probability of a base substitution at a given site is small
       over the lengths of time involved in a branch of the phylogeny.
    4. The expected amounts of change in different branches of the
       phylogeny do not vary by so much that two changes in a high-rate
       branch are more probable than one change in a low-rate branch.
    5. The expected amounts of change do not vary enough among sites that
       two changes in one site are more probable than one change in
       another.

   That these are the assumptions of parsimony methods has been documented
   in a series of papers of mine: (1973a, 1978b, 1979, 1981b, 1983b,
   1988b). For an opposing view arguing that the parsimony methods make no
   substantive assumptions such as these, see the papers by Farris (1983)
   and Sober (1983a, 1983b), but also read the exchange between
   Felsenstein and Sober (1986).

   Change from an occupied site to a deletion is counted as one change.
   Reversion from a deletion to an occupied site is allowed and is also
   counted as one change.
