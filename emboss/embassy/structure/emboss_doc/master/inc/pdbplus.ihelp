Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-ccfinpath]         dirlist    [./] This option specifies the location of
                                  CCF files (clean coordinate files) (input).
                                  A 'clean cordinate file' contains protein
                                  coordinate and derived data for a single PDB
                                  file ('protein clean coordinate file') or a
                                  single domain from SCOP or CATH ('domain
                                  clean coordinate file'), in CCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files, generated by using
                                  PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER (domains),
                                  contain 'cleaned-up' data that is
                                  self-consistent and error-corrected. Records
                                  for residue solvent accessibility and
                                  secondary structure are added to the file by
                                  using PDBPLUS.
  [-pdbindir]          directory  [./] This option specifies the location of
                                  PDB files (input). A PDB file contains
                                  protein coordinate and other data. A
                                  detailed explanation of the PDB file format
                                  is available on the PDB web site
                                  http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/info.html
   -pdbprefix          string     This option specifies the file prefix of PDB
                                  files (if any) (Any string)
   -mode               menu       [1] This option specifies the mode of
                                  operation. (Values: 1 (Use STRIDE only); 2
                                  (Use NACCESS only); 3 (Use STRIDE and
                                  NACCESS))
*  -thresholdsize      integer    [4] This option specifies the threshold size
                                  for SSEs (secondary structure elements)
                                  (Any integer value)
  [-ccfoutdir]         outdir     [./] This option specifies the location of
                                  CCF files (clean coordinate files) (output).
                                  A 'clean cordinate file' contains protein
                                  coordinate and derived data for a single PDB
                                  file ('protein clean coordinate file') or a
                                  single domain from SCOP or CATH ('domain
                                  clean coordinate file'), in CCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files, generated by using
                                  PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER (domains),
                                  contain 'cleaned-up' data that is
                                  self-consistent and error-corrected. Records
                                  for residue solvent accessibility and
                                  secondary structure are added to the file by
                                  using PDBPLUS.
   -logfile            outfile    [pdbplus.log] This option specifies the name
                                  of the log file for PDBPLUS
*  -slogfile           outfile    [stride.log] This option specifies the name
                                  of the log file for STRIDE
*  -nlogfile           outfile    [naccess.log] This option specifies the name
                                  of the log file for NACCESS
