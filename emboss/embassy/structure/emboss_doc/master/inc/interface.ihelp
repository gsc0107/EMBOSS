Generate inter-chain CON files from CCF files.
Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-infile]            infile     This option specifies the name of the
                                  protein CCF file (clean coordinate file)
                                  (input). A 'clean cordinate file' contains
                                  protein coordinate and derived data for a
                                  single PDB file ('protein clean coordinate
                                  file') or a single domain from SCOP or CATH
                                  ('domain clean coordinate file'), in CCF
                                  format (EMBL-like). The files, generated by
                                  using PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER
                                  (domains), contain 'cleaned-up' data that is
                                  self-consistent and error-corrected.
                                  Records for residue solvent accessibility
                                  and secondary structure are added to the
                                  file by using PDBPLUS.
   -thresh             float      [1.0] This option specifies the threshold
                                  contact distance. Contact between two
                                  residues is defined as when the van der
                                  Waals surface of any atom of the first
                                  residue comes within the threshold contact
                                  distance of the van der Waals surface of any
                                  atom of the second residue. The threshold
                                  contact distance is a user-defined distance
                                  with a default value of 1 Angstrom. (Any
                                  numeric value)
  [-outfile]           outfile    [test.con] This option specifies the name of
                                  CON file (contact file) (output). A
                                  'contact file' contains contact data for a
                                  protein or a domain from SCOP or CATH, in
                                  the CON format (EMBL-like). The contacts may
                                  be intra-chain residue-residue, inter-chain
                                  residue-residue or residue-ligand. The
                                  files are generated by using CONTACTS,
                                  INTERFACE and SITES.
   -conlogfile         outfile    [interface.log] This option specifies the
                                  name of the log file for the build. The log
                                  file contains messages about any errors
                                  arising while INTERFACE ran.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -vdwfile            datafile   [Evdw.dat] This option specifies the name of
                                  data file with van der Waals radii. The
                                  file of van der Waals radii for atoms in
                                  amino acid residues is part of the emboss
                                  distribution.
   -ignore             float      [20.0] This option specifies the threshold
                                  ignore distance. If any two atoms from two
                                  different residues are at least this
                                  distance apart then no futher inter-atomic
                                  contacts will be checked for for that
                                  residue pair . This speeds the calculation
                                  up considerably. (Any numeric value)
