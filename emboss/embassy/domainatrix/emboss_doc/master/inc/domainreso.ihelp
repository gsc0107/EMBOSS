Remove low resolution domains from a DCF file.
Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-cpdbpath]          dirlist    [./] This option specifies the location of
                                  domain CCF file (clean coordinate files)
                                  (input). A 'clean cordinate file' contains
                                  coordinate and other data for a single PDB
                                  file or a single domain from SCOP or CATH,
                                  in CCF format (EMBL-like). The files,
                                  generated by using PDBPARSE (pdb files) or
                                  DOMAINER (domains), contain 'cleaned-up'
                                  data that is self-consistent and
                                  error-corrected. Records for residue solvent
                                  accessibility and secondary structure are
                                  added to the file by using PDBPLUS.
  [-dcfinfile]         infile     This option specifies the name of DCF file
                                  (domain classification file) (input). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   -threshold          float      [2.8] This option specifies the threshold
                                  for inclusion (Angstroms). Domains exceeding
                                  the threshold for inclusion (Angstroms)
                                  will not be given in the output file. (Any
                                  numeric value)
  [-dcfoutfile]        outfile    [test.scop] This option specifies the name
                                  of DCF file (domain classification file)
                                  (output). A 'domain classification file'
                                  contains classification and other data for
                                  domains from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
