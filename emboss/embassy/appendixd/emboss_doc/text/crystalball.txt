Function

   Answers every drug discovery question about a sequence

Description

   Crystalball is an application invented by Scott Markel and Darryl Leon
   in their book "Sequence Analysis in a Nutshell". They put the
   description into Appendix D with the comment:

   Here's a program we're working on. When it's finished we plan to donate
   it to the EMBOSS package. It may take us a while, so be patient

   It took just 30 minutes from seeing a draft of Appendix D to sending
   Scott the ACD file and then the C source code.

   Like Scott and Darryl, we put the program into an EMBASSY package
   called "appendixd" in the hope that nobody takes it too seriously,
   although we suspect the results are more accurate than one would
   reasonably be entitled to expect.

Algorithm

   Scott and Darryl defined the ACD interface in the book, together with 3
   of the responses.

   We added the others in the same spirit.

   No attempt is made to change the output when the input sequence
   changes.
