Removes fragment sequences from DHF files.
Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-dhfinpath]         dirlist    [./] This option specifies the location of
                                  DHF files (domain hits files) or other
                                  sequence files (input). A 'domain hits file'
                                  contains database hits (sequences) with
                                  domain classification information, in FASTA
                                  or EMBL formats. The hits are relatives to a
                                  SCOP or CATH family and are found from a
                                  search of a sequence database. Files
                                  containing hits retrieved by PSIBLAST are
                                  generated by using SEQSEARCH. Alternatively,
                                  SEQFRAGGLE will accept sequence or sequence
                                  sets in any of the common formats.
   -thresh             integer    [50] This option specifies the percentage of
                                  median length for definition of fragments.
                                  SEQFRAGGLE first determines the median
                                  length of all the sequences in the input
                                  file, then discards any hit sequences which
                                  are not within a threshold percentage of the
                                  median length. The remaining sequences are
                                  written to the output file. (Any integer
                                  value)
  [-dhfoutdir]         outdir     [./] This option specifies the location of
                                  DHF files (domain hits files) (output). A
                                  'domain hits file' contains database hits
                                  (sequences) with domain classification
                                  information, in FASTA or EMBL formats. The
                                  hits are relatives to a SCOP or CATH family
                                  and are found from a search of a sequence
                                  database. Files containing hits retrieved by
                                  PSIBLAST are generated by using SEQSEARCH.
                                  Alternatively, SEQFRAGGLE will write output
                                  files in any of the common formats.
