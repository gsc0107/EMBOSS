    help: "An asterisk in the protein sequence indicates the position
           of a STOP codon. Checktrans assumes that all ORFs end in a STOP
           codon. Forcing the sequence to end with an asterisk, if there is
           not one there already, makes checktrans treat the end as a
           potential ORF. If an asterisk is added, it is not included in the
           reported count of STOPs."
