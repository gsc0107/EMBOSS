**  Application name
**  hmmgen 
**  
**  
**  
**  Summary
**  Generates a hidden Markov model for each alignment in a directory by using 
**  the HMMER package.
**
**  
**  
**  Input and Output
**  hmmgen reads a directory of scop family alignments file and generates a 
**  hidden Markov model for each alignment by using the HMMER package.
**  The scop Sunid (an integer) of a family will be used as the base name for
**  its hmm file. The paths and extensions for the alignment (input) and
**  hmm (output) files are provided by the user. 
**  
**  
**   
**  Sister applications
**  A 'scop family alignment file' contains a sequence alignment of domains 
**  belonging to the same scop family.  The file is in embl-like format and is
**  annotated with records describing the SCOP classification of the family.  A
**  scop family alignment file generatd by scopalign will contain a structure-
**  based sequence alignment of domains of known structure only.  Such 
**  alignments can be extended with sequence relatives (of unknown structure)
**  to the family in question by using seqalign.
**  The hmm output file is used by modelscan.
**  
**  
**  
**  Notes
**  When running hmmgen at the HGMP it is essential that the command 'use 
**  hmmer' (which runs the script /packages/menu/USE/hmmer) is given 
**  before it is run.  If run elsewhere, hmmgen requires a working version
**  of hmmer.

**  Description
**  This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly or 
**  indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and scop.  
**  This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline described in an
**  accompanying document.  We provide the software in the hope that it will
**  be useful.  The applications were designed for specific research purposes
**  and may not be useful or reliable in contexts other than the described 
**  pipeline.  The development of the suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to
**  whom enquiries and bug reports should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).
**  
**  hmmgen provides a convenient means to generate hidden Markov models
**  for scop families.  The HMMs are descriptive of the family and can be
**  used to identify sequence relatives of the family.
