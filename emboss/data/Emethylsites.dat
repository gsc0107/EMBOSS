# Methylation data for the restrict application
# The first column gives the name of the methylase: this is
# currently unused by the program but must be supplied.
# The second column gives the recognition site for the methylase
# The third column gives the recognition site with the methylated bases
# substituted by 'N' (the restrict application always regards N as a
# mismatch).
# If the methylation option is selected then any sequence segments matching
# a pattern in the second column will be replaced by the pattern in the
# third column.
