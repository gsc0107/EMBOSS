           are aligning protein sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix when 
           you are aligning nucleotide sequences. If you sequence 
           contains many small errors you should set a low gap opening 
           penalty (near zero) to avoid over-penalizing those errors."

    help: "The gap extension penalty is the score substracted when more
           spaces are added to an existing alignment gap.  Often a single 
           insertion or deletion affects multiple residues/nucleotides; 
           separate opening and extension penalties reduce the excessive 
           penalty such events would otherwise carry; generally the
           gap extension penalty should be significantly lower than
           the gap opening penalty."
